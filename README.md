### Terms of Reference Template in R Markdown

Converted from Word by Melissa Monk, NOAA SWFSC

### How to use this template

1. Make sure you have the necessary R packages installed
    * rmarkdown
    * r4ss
    * knitr
    * xtable
2. Make sure you have the necessary LaTeX packages installed
    * [package names here]

Perhaps some text could be added here on the commands required to convert an R Markdown (.Rmd) file to PDF or whatever other formats we might require.

###Directions for creating the .bib file with Mendeley (free account required).

1. Download Mendeley Desktop from https://www.mendeley.com/download-mendeley-desktop/ and also install the Web Importer (for use with Google Scholar). 
2. Join the China Rockfish Assessment 2015 group on Mendeley.
3. Either input a reference manually or import it to Mendeley from Google Scholar.
4. Add that reference to the China Rockfish Assessment 2015 folder in Mendeley Desktop.
5. Make sure the Citation Key field is not blank and matches the key you want to reference it as in the RMarkdown document.
5. Go to Documents in the China Rockfish folder in Mendeley, select all, and go to File-->Export.
6. Export the files as a .bib file, and save and overwrite the chinarockfish2015.bib file in your version-controlled China2015 working folder.
7. Make sure you include the new .bib file when you push your changes to GitHub

### When to get China Rockfish-specific

Any thoughts on when to split China-specific work from the general template?
