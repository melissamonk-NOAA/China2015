#Executive summary{-}

##Stock{-}

This assessment reports the status of the China rockfish (\emph{Sebastes nebulosus}) resource in U.S. waters off the coast of the California, Oregon, and Washington using data through 2014.  China rockfish are modelled with three independent stock assessments to account for spatial variation in exploitation history as well as regional differences in growth and size composition of the catch. The northern area model is defined as Washington state Marine Catch Areas (MCAs) 1-4.  The central area model spans from the Oregon-Washington border to $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude.  The southern area model spans $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude to the U.S.-Mexico border.  However, very little catch of China rockfish occurs south of Point Conception, California ($34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. latitude).

##Catches{-}
China rockfish are most often caught by hook-and-line (both recreational and commercial fisheries) as well as by traps in the commercial live-fish fishery.  Although China rockfish were not a major target species, the commercial rockfish fishery along the U.S. Pacific West Coast developed in the late 1800s and early 1990s. Available estimates of China rockfish catch in California begin in the early 1900s, along with small commercial catches in Oregon until recreational landings began to increase in the early 1970s (Figures \ref{fig:Exec_wa_catch}-\ref{fig:Exec_ca_catch}). Reconstructed recreational landings of China rockfish in the northern assessment begin in 1967. As of 1995, Washington has prohibited commercial nearshore fixed gear in state waters and does not have a historical reconstruction of China rockfish commercial landings. The majority of commercial removals of China rockfish are now landed by live-fish fisheries in California and southern Oregon. The magnitude of total removals over the last 10 years peaked in 2009 (35.52 mt) and has been decreasing since then. In recent years, California has the largest removals of the three states (dominated by the recreational fleet) with smallest removals coming from the Oregon recreational fleet (Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}).

The nearshore live-fish fishery developed in California in the late 1980s and early 1990s and extended into Oregon by the mid-1990s, driven by the market prices for live fish.  Northern Oregon (north of Florence) does not contribute significantly to the live-fish fishery (maximum removal of 0.02 mt) as the market for this sector of the fishery is centered in California.  Catches from the live-fish fishery in southern Oregon (south of Florence) has composed the majority of the catch in that state since 1999, and peaked in 2002.  In California, the landings of live fish begin exceeding the landings of dead fish south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude in 1998 and north of  $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude in 1999; and the pattern continues through 2014.

The historical reconstruction of landings from the recreational fishery for China rockfish in California goes back to 1928, and the fishery began significantly increasing in the late 1940s.  The recreational catches in California are significantly higher than the commercial catches, and have decreased in the last five years (Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}).  Recreational catches in California peaked in 1987 at 53.29 mt and have declined to roughly 10-20 mt per year over the last 10 years. The trend is opposite in Oregon, with the magnitude of the commercial landings greater than the recreational landings. The historical landings from the recreational fleet in Oregon start in 1973 at 0.86 mt, peak in 1983 at 6.07 mt and again in 1993 at 6.04 mt.  The recreational catches over the last 10 years in Oregon have ranged from 1.67 mt in 2014 to 3.66 mt in 2007.  Recreational landings in Washington peaked in 1992 (7.98 mt) and have remained between 2-4 mt from 2005-2014.

##Data and assessment{-}
China rockfish was assessed as a data moderate stock in 2013 [@Cope2015] using the XDB-SRA modeling framework.  This assessment uses the newest version of Stock Synthesis (3.24u).  The model begins in 1900, and assumes the stock was at an unfished equilibrium that year.

Data within the central and northern models were stratified as follows: central model north and south of Florence, OR and the northern model groups MCAs 1-2 (southern WA) and MCAs 3-4 (northern WA) (Figure \ref{fig:assess_region_map}).  Data for the management area south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude are aggregated, in part because historical removals from the dominant fisheries (recreational charter and private boat modes) prior to 2004 are not available at a finer spatial scale. The data used in the assessments includes commercial and recreational landings, Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE) indices from recreational and commercial fleets, and length and age compositions.  Discard data (total discards in mt and size compositions) from the commercial live-fish fishery were modelled south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude.  Where available, age and length compositions for the recreational party/charter (CPFV) and private/rental modes were developed separately.

##Stock biomass{-}
Estimated spawning output in the northern area (Washington state) declined between the 1960s and 1990s but has been largely stable during the past two decades (Figure \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all} and Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_N}).  The estimated relative depletion level (spawning output relative to unfished spawning output) of the northern stock in 2015 is 73.4% (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 63.6% - 83.2%) (Figure \ref{fig:reldeplete_all}).

The central area model for China rockfish estimates that spawning output is just above the biomass target in 2015 (Figure \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all} and Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_C}). The rate of spawning output decline is estimated to be steepest during the 1980s to 1990s and continued to decline from the early 2000s at a slower rate to an estimated minimum of 39.6% in 2014. The estimated relative depletion level of the central stock in 2015 is 61.5% (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 53.8% - 69.2%) (Figure \ref{fig:reldeplete_all}).

The assessment for the southern management area suggests that China rockfish were lightly, but steadily exploited since the early 1900s, with more rapid declines in spawning output beginning with development of the recreational fishery in the 1950s (Figure \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all} and Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_S}). The estimated relative depletion level of the southern stock in 2015 is 29.6% (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 25.0% - 34.3%) (Figure \ref{fig:reldeplete_all}). Although spawning output in the southern area is more depleted than the central and northern areas, it is the only area with an increasing trend over the past 15 years.

##Recruitment{-}
Length and age composition data for China rockfish contain insufficient information to reliably resolve year-class strength. Therefore, all three base models assume that recruitment follows a deterministic Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship, so trends in recruitment reflect trends in estimated spawning output. Given the assumed value of steepness and estimates of current stock status, estimated recruitment has remained fairly constant in the central and northern models, while the estimated biomass in the southern area has declined enough to impact spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:recruits_all}, Tables \ref{tab:Recruit_N}, \ref{tab:Recruit_C} and \ref{tab:Recruit_S}).

##Exploitation status{-}
Harvest rates estimated by the northern area model for Washington have never exceeded management target levels (Table \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_N} and Figure \ref{fig:spr_all}). Model results for the central area suggest that harvest rates have briefly exceeded the current proxy MSY value around 2000, but has remained below the management target in the last decade (Table \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_C} and Figure \ref{fig:spr_all}). Historical harvest rates for China rockfish rose steadily in the southern management area until the mid-1990s and exceeded the target SPR harvest rate for several decades, and is just below the target harvest rate as of 2013 (Table \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_S} and Figure \ref{fig:spr_all}).

##Ecosystem considerations{-}
In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in the analysis.  This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.

Recently available habitat information was used to select the data used in the onboard observer indices (see Appendix F, p. \ref{sec:AppendixF}).

##Reference points{-}
The management line for China rockfish is at $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, with differing management guidelines north and south.  From 2005-2010, the Nearshore Rockfish Complexes north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude were managed by a total catch Optimum Yield (OY).  As of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) 2011-12 management cycle, China rockfish has a component OFL and ABC within the northern and southern Nearshore Rockfish Complexes, based on the work by Dick and MacCall [-@Dick2010].

This stock assessment estimates that China rockfish in the north are above the biomass target. The spawning output of the stock declined between the 1960s and 1990s but has largely been stable during the past few decades.  The estimated relative depletion level in 2015 is 73.4% (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 63.7% - 83.2%, corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 24.4 billion eggs (~95% asymptotic interval: 15.2 – 33.7 billion eggs) of spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_N}).  Unfished age 5+ biomass was estimated to be 240.8 mt in the base case model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target ($SB_{40\%}$) is 9.8 billion eggs, which gives a catch of 6.3 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is 5.8 mt.

This stock assessment estimates that central area China rockfish are just above the biomass target. The rate of spawning output decline is estimated to be steepest during the 1980s to 1990s and has continued to decline since the 1990s at a slower rate. The estimated relative depletion level in 2015 is 61.5% (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 53.8% - 69.2%), corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 65.1 billion eggs (~95% asymptotic interval: 51.8 – 78.4 billion eggs) of spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_C}). Unfished age 5+ biomass was estimated to be 591.5 mt in the base case model. The target spawning output  based on the biomass target ($SB_{40\%}$) is 26 billion eggs, which gives a catch of 15.7 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is 14.5 mt. 

This stock assessment estimates that China rockfish south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude are below the biomass target, but above the minimum stock size threshold, and have been increasing over the last 15 years. The estimated relative depletion level in 2015 is 27.9% (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 21.2% - 34.7%), corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 66.5 billion eggs (~95% asymptotic interval:  49.6 - 83.4 billion eggs) of spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_S}). Unfished age 5+ biomass was estimated to be 768.6 mt in the base case model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target ($SB_{40\%}$) is 26.6 billion eggs, which gives a catch of 21.1 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is 19.5 mt.

##Management performance{-}
China rockfish is managed in the northern and southern Nearshore Rockfish Complex (split at $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude.  Since the 2011-2012 management cycle, China rockfish has a contribution OFL and ACL within each the northern and southern Nearshore Rockfish Complexes (Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}).  The estimated catch of China rockfish north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude of  Nearshore Rockfish Complex has been above both the China rockfish contribution to the northern Nearshore Rockfish Complex OFL and ACL in all years (2011-2014).  The estimated catch of China rockfish south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude of  Nearshore Rockfish Complex has been below the  China rockfish contribution to the northern Nearshore Rockfish Complex OFL and ACL in all years (2011-2014).  A summary of these values as well as other base case summary results can be found in Table \ref{tab:base_summary}.

##Unresolved problems and major uncertainties{-}
As in most/all stock assessments, the appropriate value for stock-recruit steepness remains a major uncertainty for China rockfish. In this assessment a prior value was available from a meta-analysis, allowing bracketing of the uncertainty. Exploration of the southern model during the STAR panel meeting established that the range of uncertainty in current and projected biomass status provided by this bracketing was very similar to the range due to natural mortality, and that natural mortality alone would be used to bracket uncertainty in model results for management advice.

While the northern and the southern area models are able to estimate a plausible value of natural mortality with an apparently good level of precision, this was not possible with the central area model. 

The fishery-dependent abundance indices used in the assessment are relatively noisy.  There is no fishery-independent index. The assessments assume that trends in CPUE indices are representative of population trends.

Assessment results for the central and the northern area models are dependent on the method used for weighting the conditional age-at-length data.  This is an area of active research and there is a lack of consensus on an agreed approach.  A workshop is planned for later this year that might provide guidance.  For this assessment, the Panel recommended use of harmonic mean method, because it is a well-understood and frequently applied method that provided intermediate results compared to other alternatives.

The current term of reference for stock assessment require development of a single decision table with states of nature ranging along the dominant axis of uncertainty.  This presumes that uncertainty is consequential only for a single variable or estimated quantity, such as natural mortality, steepness, or ending biomass. This approach may fail to capture important elements of uncertainty that should be communicated to the Council and its advisory bodies.  Additional flexibility in the development of decision tables is needed.

##Decision Tables{-}
The forecasts of stock abundance and yield were developed using the final base models. The total catches in 2015 and 2016 are set to the PFMC adopted China rockfish contribution ACLs in the northern and central models (Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}). The southern model total catches in 2015 and 2016 are set to the average annual catch from 2012-2014. The exploitation rate for 2017 and beyond is based upon an SPR harvest rate of 50%. The average of 2010-2014 catch by fleet was used to distribute catches in forecasted years.  The forecasted projections of the OFL for each model are presented in Table \ref{tab:OFL_projection}.

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the three states of nature agreed upon at the STAR panel and are based on a low value of M, 0.05, and a high value, 0.09. Current medium-term forecasts based on the alternative states of nature project that the stock, under the current control rule as applied to the base model, will decline towards the target stock size Table \ref{tab:decision_table_north}. The current control rule under the low state of nature results in a stock decline into the precautionary zone, while the high state of nature maintains the stock at near unfished levels. Removing the catches resulting from the low M state of nature, assuming the base and high values of M both maintain the stock at well above the current target stock size, as does removing the recent average catches under all states of nature. Removing the high M catches under the base model M and high M states of nature results in the population going to extremely low levels during the projection period, spawning biomass and stock depletion values are not reported for years in which the stock goes to these very low levels. 

Current medium-term forecasts based on the alternative states of nature for the central model project that the stock, under the current control rule as applied to the base model, will decline towards the target stock size Table \ref{tab:decision_table_central}. The current control rule under the low state of nature results in a stock in the precautionary zone, while the high state of nature maintains the stock increasing from 40% to 50% depletion from 2017 - 2026.  Removing the catches resulting from the low M state of nature, assuming the base and high values of M both maintain the stock at well above the current target stock size.  Removing the high M catches under the base model M and low M states of nature results in the population going to extremely low levels during the projection period.  Removing average catches under the base M and high M states of nature result in the stock remaining above the current target stock size, and an ending depletion of 37% in 2026 for the low M state of nature.

Assuming that catches in 2015 and 2016 equal recent average catch, and that catches beginning in 2017 follow the default ACL harvest control rule, projections of expected China spawning output from the southern base model suggest the stock will be at roughly 30% of unfished spawning output in 2017, and increase to 38% by 2026 (Table \ref{tab:decision_table_south}). The stock is expected to remain below the target stock size (40% of unfished spawning output) in the base model and “low M” states of nature through 2026, and to exceed target size in the “high M” scenario, assuming stationarity in the stock-recruitment assumptions.

##Research and data needs{-}
We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The number of hours fished in Washington should be recorded for each dockside sample (vessel) so that future CPUE can be measured as angler hours rather than just number of anglers per trip. This will allow for a more accurate calculation of effort.

\item The number of hours fished in Oregon should be recorded for each dockside sample (vessel), instead of the start and end times of the entire trip.  This will allow for a more accurate calculation of effort.

\item Compare the habitat-based methods used to subset data for the onboard observer indices to Stephens-MacCall and other filtering methods.

\item Explore the sensitivity of Stephens-MacCall when the target species is “rare” or not common encountered in the data samples.

\item A standardized fishery independent survey sampling nearshore rockfish in all three states would provide a more reliable index of abundance than the indices developed from catch rates in recreational and commercial fisheries. However, information value of such surveys would depend on the consistency in methods over time and space and would require many years of sampling before an informative index could be obtained.

\item A coastwide evaluation of genetic structure of China rockfish is a research priority. Genetic samples should be collected at sites spaced regularly along the coast throughout the range of the species to estimate genetic differences at multiple spatial scales (i.e., isolation by distance).
 
\item Difficulties were encountered when attempting to reconstruct historical recreational catches at smaller spatial scales, and in distinguishing between landings from the private and charter vessels. Improved methods are needed to allocate reconstructed recreational catches to sub-state regions within each fishing mode.

\item There was insufficient time during the STAR Panel review to fully review the abundance indices used in the China rockfish assessments. Consideration should be given to scheduling a data workshop prior to STAR Panel review for review of assessment input data and standardization procedures for indices, potentially for all species scheduled for assessment.  The nearshore data workshop, held earlier this year, was a step in this direction, but that meeting did not deal with the modeling part of index development.
 
\item The Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) index in Oregon was excluded from the assessment model because it was learned that multiple intercept interviews were done for a single trip. Evaluate whether database manipulations or some other approach can resolve this issue and allow these data to be used in the assessment. 
 
\item Many of the indices used in the China rockfish assessment model used the Stephens-MacCall (2004) approach to subset the CPUE data. Research is need to evaluate the performance of the method when there are changes in management restrictions and in relative abundance of different species. Examination of the characteristics of trips retained/removed should be a routine part of index standardization, such as an evaluation of whether there are time trends in the proportion of discarded trips.
 
\item Fishery-dependent CPUE indices are likely to be the only trend information for many nearshore species for the foreseeable future.  Indices from a multi-species hook-and-line fishery may be influenced by regulatory changes, such as bag limits, and by interactions with other species (e.g., black rockfish) due to hook competition.  It may be possible to address many of these concerns if a multi-species approach is used to develop the indices, allowing potential interactions and common forcing to be evaluated.
 
\item Consider the development of a fishery-independent survey for nearshore stocks. As the current base model structure has no direct fishery-independent measure of stock trends, any work to commence collection of such a measure for nearshore rockfish, or use of existing data to derive such an index would greatly assist with this assessment.
 
\item Basic life history research may help to resolve assessment uncertainties regarding appropriate values for natural mortality and steepness.
 
\item Examine length composition data of discarded fish from recreational onboard observer programs in California and Oregon. Consider modeling discarded catch using selectivity and retention functions in Stock Synthesis rather than combining retained and discarded catch and assuming they have identical size compositions. Another option would be to model discarded recreational catch as a separate fleet, similar to the way commercial discards were treated in the southern model.
 
\item Ageing data were influential in the China rockfish stock assessments. Collection and ageing of China rockfish otoliths should continue.  Samples from younger fish not typically selected by the fishery are needed to better define the growth curve.
 
\item Consider evaluating depletion estimators of abundance using within season CPUE indices.  This approach would require information on total removals on a reef-by-reef basis.
 
\item The extensive use of habitat information in index development is a strength of the China rockfish assessment. Consideration should be given to how to further incorporate habitat data into the assessment of nearshore species.  The most immediate need seems to be to increase the resolution of habitat maps for waters off Oregon and Washington, and standardization of habitat data format among states.
 
\item Although all the current models for China rockfish estimated implausibly large recruitment deviations when allowed to do so, particularly early in the modeled time period, further exploration of available options in stock synthesis could produce acceptable results. In addition, this work may provide guidance on any additional options that could be added to stock synthesis to better handle this situation. For example, assuming different levels autocorrelation in the stock-recruit relationship for data-moderate stocks may help curb the tendency to estimate extreme recruitment with sparse datasets.
 
\item Research is needed on data-weighting methods in stock assessments. In particular, a standard approach for conditional age-at-length data is needed.  The Center for the Advancement of Population Assessment Methodology (CAPAM) data weighting workshop, scheduled for later this year, should make important progress on this research need.

#Introduction

##Basic Information and Life History

China rockfish (\emph{Sebastes nebulosus}) is a medium-sized, commercially (mainly in the live-fish fishery) and recreationally prized deeper-dwelling nearshore rockfish ranging from southern California, north to the Gulf of Alaska [@Love2002].  Core abundance is found from northern California to
southern British Columbia, Canada. China rockfish are rarely encountered in the Southern California Bight [@Love1998]. 

There is limited information available on either stock structure or life history.  No genetic research has been conducted for China rockfish, and no published research indicates separate stocks along the West Coast.  China rockfish do not appear to exhibit sexual dimorphism [@Lenarz1991], although data are limited.  Fits to von Bertalanffy growth curves [@vonB1938] using age-length data from Washington, Oregon, and California indicate regional differences in growth and estimates of $L_\infty$.  These data represent fish collected from the recreational and commercial sectors as well as for research.

China rockfish are among the longer-lived rockfish.  Love [-@Love2002] reports China rockfish live to at least 79 years, which is corroborated by the available age data used in this assessment. The oldest aged China rockfish from Alaska was 78 years old [@Munk2001].  Recently aged China rockfish from the West Coast had a maximum age of 83 years from California (recreational or research) in 1973.  The oldest aged fish from Oregon was 79 from the commercial dead-fish fishery in 2003 and in Washington, 77 years from the recreational fleet in 2000.  

Little is known about the maturity schedule and fecundity of China rockfish.  Echeverria [-@Echeverria1987] collected 69 China rockfish, of which the age at first maturity was 3 years for males and females (26 cm).  Both males and females exhibited 50% maturity at 4 years (27 cm) and 100% maturity at 6 years (30 cm).  A study by Lea et al. [-@Lea1999] captured females releasing larvae in April and May, and spent females in April, June and October off the coast of California.   Echeverria [-@Echeverria1987] identified January - June as the months of parturition for China rockfish in north-central California, with the peak of reproductive activity in January.

One diet study indicated that China rockfish in central California predominantly feed on crustaceans and ophiuroids, while the diets of China rockfish in northern California was dominated by crustaceans and mollusks [@Lea1999]. This is similar to the diet described by Love et al. [-@Love2002] of benthic organisms, including brittle stars, crabs, and shrimps.

Both juvenile and adult China rockfish tend to be solitary and exhibit high site fidelity within rocky habitats. Surveys of rockfishes in \emph{Nereocystis} and \emph{Macrocystis} kelp forests observed China rockfish in only the \emph{Macrocystis} kelp forests, and overall sightings within the kelp forests were rare [@Bodkin1986].  Juvenile China rockfish inhabit shallow, subtidal waters [@Love2002], and an experimental study with captive China rockfish found that juveniles exhibit both site fidelity and territoriality [@Lee2009].  A tag and recapture study by Lea et al. [-@Lea1999] indicated China rockfish have high site fidelity.  While Lea et al. [-@Lea1999] did not report exact distances, all China rockfish from the study were recaptured in the same "general locality at which they were released."  In other rockfish movement studies, China rockfish were tagged but never recaptured [@Hanan2012], or there was a sample size of one fish [@Hannah2011].  An ongoing study has used acoustic telemetry to tag and track seven China rockfish at Redfish Rocks, off the south coast of Oregon (pers. comm. Tom Calvanese, Oregon State University).  The location where each fish was released after tagging was recorded using GPS. The maximum distance traveled from release point was calculated using the location of the most distant receiver at which that fish was detected, plus 250 m (estimated receiver detection range).  Preliminary analyses estimate the maximum distance traveled by China rockfish (n=7) averaged 1,344 $\pm$ 334 m between May 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012.

Little is known about dispersal of juvenile China rockfish during the pelagic stage, and they are not captured in the Southwest Fisheries Science Center's (SWFSC) juvenile rockfish cruise.  The 2013 assessment model treated the species as two stocks, north and south of Cape Mendocino, CA ($40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude), which is also the management boundary for China rockfish.  For this assessment we explore assessment models north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, as well as separate northern California/Oregon and Washington models in the north.  

###Early Life History
China rockfish, like other species in the genus \emph{Sebastes}, are iteroparous, have internal fertilization, and bear live young. Gestation periods range from 1-2 months among the \emph{Sebastes} spp. that have been studied, but no data specific to China rockfish were found in our literature search. Parturition (release of larvae into the water) by China rockfish was reported between January and June in Central California [@Echeverria1987], but the duration of the pelagic larval and juvenile stages is unknown. Closely-related, nearshore rockfish species (e.g. gopher, black-and-yellow, kelp, and copper) recruit at small sizes (1.5-2 cm), and are thought to have short pelagic juvenile stages relative to other \emph{Sebastes} [@Anderson1983; @Love2002].


##Map
A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for fisheries or data collection strata is provided in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_map}.


##Ecosystem Considerations

In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in the analysis.  However, we did use information on the distribution of rocky habitat to inform the onboard observer program indices of relative abundance from California and Oregon.  The onboard observer program collects location-specific encounters of China rockfish.  We overlaid the locations of China rockfish encounters with high-resolution bathymetry data to obtain a proxy of the extent of China rockfish habitat (see Appendix F for details, p.\pageref{sec:AppendixF}).

Much research is needed to elucidate the role of China rockfish in the ecosystem, including predator/prey interactions.  


##Fishery Information and Summary of Management History
The rockfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast first developed off California in the late 19th century as a hook-and-line fishery [@Love2002].  The rockfish trawl fishery was established in the early 1940s, when the United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein [@Alverson1964; @Harry1961]. China rockfish are most commonly captured by hook-and-line or traps.  They are rarely encountered in the trawl fishery due to the elusive behavior and affinity for rocky crevices.  Their high site fidelity and territoriality lend to the evasiveness of the species.  

Catch reconstructions of China rockfish indicate a developing fishery in California in the 1940s, and not until the 1970s in Oregon. The recreational fishery in Washington developed in the late 1960s, but the magnitude of catches compared to the other states is relatively small.  China rockfish is not a directed target recreational species in any of the three states.

Prior to 2000, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC; Council) managed the fishery for China rockfish as part of the \emph{Sebastes} complex, with no separate Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) or Optimum Yield (OY) for China rockfish.  In 2000, the Council established the northern and southern Nearshore Complexes (north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude), of which China rockfish is included.

The Council established management guidelines for the northern and southern Nearshore Rockfish Complexes in the 2005-2006 management cycle (Total Catch OY;  122 mt north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude and 615 mt south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude).  The 2011-2012 management cycle adopted and Overfishing Limit (OFL) and Annual Catch Limit (ACL) for the northern and southern Nearshore Rockfish Complexes, and the China rockfish contribution to the complex, which differ north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude.  In 2003, the Council established Rockfish Conservation Areas to control catches of overfished rockfish species, and large portions of the shelf were closed to fishing. 

In 1995, Washington closed commercial hook-and-line gear in state waters (0-3 miles).  Oregon’s commercial nearshore fishery developed in the mid-1990s as an open access fishery.  Oregon adopted formal management of the commercial nearshore fishery in 2004.  Oregon adopted a 12 inch size limit in the commercial fishery for China rockfish in 2000, and California did the same in 2001.  California required a nearshore fishery permit as of 1999 and has had area-specific closures since 2000 to minimize interactions with canary and yelloweye rockfishes.

Washington adopted depth closures for the recreational fishery in 2006 for MCAs 2 (closed seaward of 30 fm), 3 (closed seaward of 20 fm) and 4 (closed seaward of 20 fm).  

In November 2002, Oregon implemented the first depth closure seaward of 27 fm.  In general, from June 1 - September 30, groundfish are prohibited seaward of 40 fm from 2004-2009.  In July 2010 and 2011, seaward of 20 fm was closed due to yelloweye rockfish interactions.  From 2012-2014, groundfish take seaward of 30 fm from April 1-September 30 is prohibited.  As of 2015, retention of China rockfish is prohibited in the Oregon recreational fishery.

California adopted a 3-hook and 1-line regulation in 2000, which changed to 2-hooks and 1-line in 2001.  California manages the recreational fishery through management areas, which have been dynamic through time.  In general starting in 2004, north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude  to the CA/OR border, the nearshore rockfish fishery is closed seaward of 30 fm May-December, (and closed in January-April as of 2005).  In 2008, the depths seaward of  20 fm were closed May-August and the closures from September-December change annually through 2014.  Depth closures between Pt. Conception and Cape Mendocino have been much more dynamic.  In general, depth closures began in 2001 at 20 fm and have dynamically varied by month and depth (20-40 fm) through 2014. 
 


##Management Performance
China rockfish is managed in the northern and southern Nearshore Rockfish Complex, split at $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude.  Since the 2011-2012 management cycle, China rockfish has a contribution OFL and ACL within each the northern and southern Nearshore Rockfish Complexes (Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}).  The estimated catch of China rockfish north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude of  Nearshore Rockfish Complex has been above both the China rockfish contribution to the northern Nearshore Rockfish Complex OFL and ACL in all years (2011-2014).  The estimated catch of China rockfish south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude of  Nearshore Rockfish Complex has been below the  China rockfish contribution to the northern Nearshore Rockfish Complex OFL and ACL in all years (2011-2014).  A summary of these values as well as other base case summary results can be found in Table \ref{tab:base_summary}.

#Assessment

##Data
Data used in the China rockfish assessment are summarized in Figures \ref{fig:data_sources_N} - \ref{fig:data_sources_S}.  A description of each data source is below.


###Fishery-Dependent Data: Commercial Landings

**Washington**

Washington does not have a nearshore commercial fishery and there are no records of China rockfish being landed by any commercial gears in Washington.  There is no record of tribal catch of China rockfish in Washington.   

**Oregon**

China rockfish landings from Oregon commercial fisheries were minor until twenty years ago (Table \ref{tab:OR_comm_removal}, Figure \ref{fig:OR_comm_removal}).    Prior to the mid-1990s, there were only trace landings of China rockfish from longline fisheries (i.e., less than one metric ton per year), and no landings from the trawl fisheries (based on species composition samples  obtained since the 1960s) [@Douglas1998].  However, landings of China rockfish rapidly increased from 1995-2000 due to the emergence of a live-fish market that paid high prices for ornate rockfish, such as China rockfish (especially in Southern Oregon).  Following a peak in catch from 1998-2000, decreased landings of China rockfish during the early 2000s coincided with new regulations designed to limit harvests from the live fish fishery, such as landings limits, permit limits, and minimum size limits [@Rodomsky2014]. 


There is a relatively high degree of confidence in the accuracy of historic China rockfish landings because comprehensive sampling of commercial landings began before the fishery for China rockfish developed.  Specifically, since 1992, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has obtained robust species composition samples from landings categories containing China rockfish at fine levels of stratification (i.e., year, quarter, gear, disposition, area caught, and market category).  China rockfish landed into improper market categories, has been practically non-existent, presumably due to the high price differential for China rockfish (as opposed to other rockfish).  China rockfish landings since 1992 were obtained from PacFIN, which estimates species specific landings of rockfish by the above mentioned strata.


However, China rockfish landings could not be obtained from PacFIN prior to 1992 since China rockfish were not included in species composition samples (of rockfish category landings) from the longline and rod-and-reel fisheries (and thus China rockfish landings incorrectly appear as zeros in PacFIN).  Accordingly, landings of China rockfish were obtained from the commercial catch reconstruction developed by Karnowski et al. [-@Karnowski2014], whom borrowed species compositions (from earliest complete years) and applied them to market category landings from years before species compositions were obtained. 


All China rockfish landings from the Karnowski et al. [-@Karnowski2014] reconstruction were used except for those occurring from the salmon troll fishery, which were reported as 1-2 metric tons per year from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s.  Since a species composition had never been obtained from the market categories containing China rockfish for the salmon troll fishery, Karnowski et al. [-@Karnowski2014] borrowed species compositions from the recreational salmon fishery and applied them the commercial salmon troll fishery landings.  Although China rockfish appeared in the recreational salmon fishery landings, it was concluded at the Nearshore Stock Assessment Workshop ([Agenda Item D.8 Attachment 10](http://tinyurl.com/ndrrx9r), June 2015) that the China rockfish caught during recreational salmon trips were not caught by troll gear, but rather by jig gear from anglers who also targeted benthic rockfish species before or after trolling for salmon.  Since China rockfish are associated with rocky reef habitat [@Love1998] and salmon trollers fish the surface waters for coho salmon and avoid rocky reefs when fishing for Chinook salmon (to prevent entanglement of expensive downrigger gear on rocks), it was deemed improbable that China rockfish be caught by salmon troll gear.   


**California**

The [CALCOM](http://128.114.3.187/) database was queried (May 15, 2015) for commercial landing estimates of China rockfish in California, 1969-2014. Landings were stratified by year, quarter, live/dead, market category, gear group, port complex, and source of species composition data (actual port samples, borrowed samples, or assumed nominal market category).

The majority of commercial China rockfish landings are made by vessels using hook-and-line gear (Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_1}). However, CALCOM landings estimates also include a large fraction of trawl-caught China rockfish from 1969-1988, which is unlikely given the species’ preference for rocky habitat. The reported trawl catch was mainly from the Monterey port complex and was landed in the “China rockfish” market category (258).

An analysis of species composition data from port samples in market category 258, by gear type, revealed that the sampled trawl-caught landings contained mainly deeper-water species, including greenspotted rockfish (*Sebastes chlorostictus*), sometimes known as “chinafish.” Species landed by hook-and-line gears in the China rockfish market category, on the other hand, consisted of a mixture of nearshore species (e.g., China, quillback, gopher, black-and-yellow, and brown; Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_2}). When port samples are not available to estimate species composition in a stratum, and no samples are available to ‘borrow’ from an adjacent stratum, landings in a market category are assigned to the ‘nominal’ species category, in this case China rockfish.

Given the available species composition data from the trawl catch, and the fact that trawl gear is unlikely to be fished in China rockfish habitat, estimates of trawl-caught China rockfish were removed from the landings estimates in the current assessment. A similar analysis led to the removal of a small amount (about 5 mt) of landings by set-net and mid-water trawl gear groups.

In years prior to 1978, landing receipts are available for California but there are no associated port sample data. In CALCOM, a ratio estimator (based on the expanded landings estimates in the earliest sampled years) is used to allocate catch to species in unsampled years. In the case of China rockfish, this procedure propagated the estimates of trawl-caught China backward in time to 1969 (Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_1}). These ratio estimates of trawl-caught China rockfish were also removed from the final time series of landed catch.

The previous assessment of China rockfish [@Cope2015] modeled two China rockfish populations, north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude (roughly Cape Mendocino). The majority of landings occurred south of Cape Mendocino, and the revised estimates are substantially lower in early years, primarily due to the removal of trawl catch (Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_3}).

California’s commercial live-fish fishery began targeting nearshore rockfish species in the mid-1980s in southern California, and condition codes (live or dead) were required on landing receipts starting in 1993 [@CalCOFI2002]. However, fish landed live are not always recorded as live landings on the landing receipts, so estimates of live landings should be viewed as a minimum estimate [@CalCOFI2002]. Live annual landings of China rockfish surpassed landings of dead fish by the late 1990s, due to the increased value of fish landed live (Table \ref{tab:CA_comm_removal}, Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_4}).

Commercial landings of China rockfish in California from 1916-1968 were obtained from the historical reconstruction of Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010], and also available from the CALCOM website. Their analysis differentiates between trawl-caught landings and “other” gears. In the case of China rockfish, less than 2 mt of landings from 1916-1968 were attributed to trawl gears, and these were excluded from the assessment. The remaining “other” gear types (cumulative removals of 197 mt from 1916-1968) landed China rockfish mainly south of Cape Mendocino, with a short pulse of landings between Cape Mendocino and the California-Oregon border in the 1930s and early 1940s (Figure \ref{fig:CA_reconstruct_landings}). Due to the relatively large landing estimates south of Cape Mendocino in the early years, catches from 1900 to 1916 were interpolated with a linear ramp from 0 mt in 1900 to 6.1 mt in 1916 (the first year of commercial landings estimated by  Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010].


###Fishery-Dependent Data: Commercial Discards

**Washington**

Discards of China rockfish likely occurred before the closure of nearshore commercial fisheries in 1995 for non-trawl gears and in 1999 for trawl gears.  However, there is no information on historical discards.  For this assessment, we assume no retention or discard of China in any commercial fisheries.       

**Oregon and California**

Estimates of discarded China rockfish in commercial fisheries were provided by the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP). These were available for the years 2003-2013 north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, and 2004-2013 to the south. WCGOP provided estimates with and without the depth-specific discard mortality rates applied. These estimates indicate that the nearshore fixed-gear fishery was the only sector with observed discards of China rockfish and there were strong differences in rates of discarding north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, (Figure \ref{fig:discard_comm_est} and Table \ref{tab:WCGOP_trip_discard}).  The mortality of discarded China rockfish is estimated by WCGOP as a function of the fishing depth which varies by year (Table \ref{tab:WCGOP_trip_discard}). The average mortality fraction south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ across all years was 59%.

Discard rates were consistently low north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, where no year had estimated mortality from discards greater than either 0.5 mt, or 5% of the landings. A linear regression relating discarded to retained catch (with intercept fixed at the origin) had a slope of  0.0269, indicating that discards on average represent 2.69% of the landings in this sector (Figure \ref{fig:discard_comm_relN}). This value is similar to a simple average of the discard fractions, which was 2.75%.

South of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, commercial landings were lower and estimated discards higher. The maximum discard mortality estimate was 1.8 mt for 2012 which was 126% of the 1.4 mt nearshore fixed gear landings in that area in that year. The total discard amount for that year, including fish estimated as surviving, was 2.7 mt, almost double the landed amount.  There is also an increasing trend over the observed period (2004-2013) with an average for the first three years of 30% of all China rockfish catch discarded and an average over the final three years of 63% discarded.

Discard patterns in the area of Northern California between $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, and $42^\circ$ N. latitude appears to be more similar to Oregon than the rest of California (Table \ref{tab:discard_comm_bylat}). Although expanded fleet-wide discard estimates were not available on this smaller spatial-scale, only 9% of observed trips between $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude to $42^\circ$ N. latitude that were associated with any catch of China rockfish had any observed discards of China rockfish. South of $40^\circ 10^\prime$, 82%-100% of such trips had observed discards of China rockfish.

The patterns of the discards in commercial fisheries suggest that north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude discard mortality of China rockfish is small enough that it is more parsimonious to account for this mortality increasing the landed catch estimates by 2.69%. South of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, total discards are greater than landings in some years and discard mortality represents a large fraction of the total mortality of China rockfish. The discards are primarily fish below the minimum legal size of 12 inches (Figure \ref{fig:S_comp_lendat_flt5mkt2}). The discard process was modelled using a retention function in the pre-STAR panel base model, but this approach did not capture the increasing trend in discard rates, which may be an indication of changes in population size structure that should be accounted for in the assessment. The final southern base model treated discarded catch as a separate fleet, exactly matching removals that were dead discarded catch, and fitting length composition data from WCGOP in the model.



###Fishery-Dependent Data: Recreational Landings and Discards

**Washington**

Historically, Washington's coastal recreational anglers have been salmon-orientated and most groundfish were considered “scrap fish” by anglers [@Buckley1967].  Beginning in the mid-1970s, and particularly in the wake of the 1974 Boldt Decision, salmon fishing opportunities became increasingly restrictive; seasons were shortened and daily limits were reduced.  The trend continued into the 1980s and 1990s.  In 1994, and for the first time in the state's history, a one year moratorium on all ocean salmon fishing was implemented in response to dwindling salmon runs.  As salmon fishing opportunities waned over time, recreational and commercial fishers began shifting their interests to other species.  Many recreational coastal anglers shifted their efforts to rockfish.  Prior to declines in salmon fishing opportunities, rockfish, though rarely discarded, were generally not targeted.  The increased interest in rockfish and other groundfish can be linked directly to the decline in salmon fishing opportunities.    

The coastal recreational fleet is composed of two sectors; privately owned vessels and charter vessels.  Throughout the history of coastal charter boat fishing, Westport has remained the center of charter boat activity; however, as the salmon fishing industry declined, the charter fleet dispersed in search of more lucrative opportunities.  Many of the vessels left the state, and some moved north where rockfish fishing was perceived as being more reliable.  Even so, there are still more charter vessels operating at Westport than at Neah Bay and La Push. 

The primary focus of coastal rockfish anglers is black rockfish.  Black rockfish occur in greater abundance and closer to shore than other coastal rockfish species, and while generally regarded as a “bottom fish,” they tend not to occupy crack and crevice habitat, thus making them more susceptible to hook-and-line fishing.  As rockfish daily limits decreased, the likelihood of recreational anglers retaining smaller rockfish species, such as China, as part of their daily bag limit likely also decreased.

China rockfish are more common in northern Washington coast (Marine Catch Areas (MCAs) 3 and 4) from south of Tatoosh Island to Pt. Grenville inside of 15 fm and are rarely encountered south of the Point Grenville.  Makah Bay and the Umatilla reef areas seem to have the largest populations in the area (Tom Burlingame, Excel Fishing Charters, pers. comm.).  China rockfish are rare off of the central Washington coast (MCA 2) from the mouth of the Queets River to Leadbetter Point.  Some chartered vessels from Westport have gone multiple seasons without encountering any China rockfish in MCA 2 (Mark Cedergreen, Westport Charterboat Association, pers. comm.).  Suitable habitat is limited in MCA 1, from the mouth of the Leadbetter Point to the mouth of Columbia River. 

Historical estimates of China rockfish catch during 1967 and 1975-1989 were based on historical sport catch report series published by Washington Department of Fisheries (Table \ref{tab:WA_rec_removal}, Figure \ref{fig:WA_rec_removal}).  Catches for 1968-1974 and 1987-1989 were based on a linear interpolations between adjacent years.  From 1990 to current, catch estimates were produced by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Ocean Sampling Program based on a catch expansion procedure that includes a complete count of vessels leaving or entering a port and dockside angler interviews.  The dockside interview program collects information on number of anglers fished, catch area, and target species.  Shorebased fishing, other than major jetties, is not sampled and is considered negligible.  Sampling and effort counts occur mainly from April to October.  Winter fishing is also considered negligible. 

We assumed an average weight of 0.88 kg/fish ([RecFIN](http://www.recfin.org/)) to convert the estimates from number of fish to metric tons for all years.  The split between charter and private vessels prior to 1990 was based on a ratio estimator using 1990-1994 data.  

More than 90% of China rockfish were caught off the northern Washington coast on an annual basis (Table \ref{tab:WA_rec_removal}) and the catch by private vessels accounted for 70%-95% of the northern catches.  In the southern area, harvest of China has been under 0.5 mt annually; and most of China rockfish were caught by charter vessels (Table \ref{tab:WA_rec_removal}, Figure \ref{fig:WA_rec_removal}). 

Release information was not available until 2002.  Number of released fish by species and the depth of release were added to OSP dockside questionnaire in 2002 and 2005, respectively.  The number of released fish by depth is estimated using the same catch expansion algorithm for retained catch.  Surface release mortalities adopted by the Groundfish Management Team (GMT) were then applied to the number of release estimates for a total mortality calculation.  The average weight of 0.88 kg/fish was also used for released fish.  For pre-2002 release, we applied proportions of released fish based on a ratio estimator using 2003-2007 data.  For the split between charter and private vessels, the same algorithm used for splitting retained catch was applied.

Discard rates are higher in northern Washington than in southern Washington.  Since 2011, more than 50% of the China rockfish caught were released by anglers.  The release rates are lower in the southern area between 14% and 26% in recent years.  This may due to the rare encountering of China off southern Washington coast. 


**Oregon Sport Fishery Removals 1973-2014**

China rockfish have been a relatively minor contributor to historic Oregon sport groundfish landings (i.e., typically less than one percent of total catch), and have primarily been from   incidental catches of anglers targeting intermixed schools of midwater rockfish species (e.g., black rockfish, blue rockfish, and yellowtail rockfish).  China rockfish removals from the Oregon sport fishery ramped up relatively quickly during the 1970s (Table \ref{tab:OR_rec_removal}, Figure \ref{fig:OR_rec_removal}), and have since ranged between two and seven metric tons every year, with considerable inter-annual variation. 

Total removals of China rockfish from the Oregon sport fisheries were obtained from estimates produced by the Oregon Recreational Boat Survey (ORBS).  To produce total catch estimates, ORBS applies catch rates from a subsample of vessels (from dockside interviews) to total effort counts at fine levels of stratification (i.e., by week, port, fishery, and type of boat).  For estimates of landings, catch rates are verified by biologists; however, estimates of discard mortality are based on angler-reported discards, and are further stratified by depth-dependent mortality rates associated with barotrauma.  Since nearly all mortality of China rockfish has been from landed catch (i.e., typically less than 0.1 mt of estimated discard mortality per year), there is relatively high degree of certainty in sport fishery removals.     

Since 2001, ORBS has produced comprehensive year-round estimates of catch and effort for all developed Oregon ports (and are available from RecFIN).  However, prior to 2001, ORBS sampling was typically only conducted at major ports during the peak months of sport fishing activity, and no estimates of catch were made for unsampled ports and times.  Accordingly, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) reconstructed historic ORBS estimates of China rockfish to include catches from all ports and times (not yet available on RecFIN), as is done in recent years.  


The sport reconstruction addressed four spatial and temporal coverage biases identified during an external review of ORBS by the RecFIN Statistical Subcommittee [@VanVoorhees2000]: (1) “major ports” that were sampled each year were not sampled during the winter months; (2) “minor ports” were not sampled at all during some years; (3) effort counts for private boats excluded afternoon and night trips; and (4) undeveloped launch sites were never sampled (e.g., beaches).  A fifth coverage bias, shoreline and estuary boat removals, was not relevant to China rockfish since landings were typically non-existent during years when sampling occurred.  
The sport reconstruction utilized ratio estimators, based on years with complete sampling, to expand catches from years with partial sampling.  For instance, the contribution of winter catch to total catch during years with complete sampling was used to the expand catches for years with missing winter catch.  Similarly, the contribution of catch from a minor port to that of the major ports during years with complete sampling was used to expand catches of years that the minor port was not sampled.  


**California**

In California, recreational fishing has accounted for over 70% of cumulative China rockfish removals statewide (1900-2014, landings and discard), and over 84% of statewide removals since 2005 (Table \ref{tab:CA_rec_removal} and Figure \ref{fig:CA_rec_removal}).  Almost all the removals are attributed to boat fishing modes (party/charter and private/rental fleets), with only a negligible contribution from shore-based fishing modes (RecFIN, 2015).

Estimates from the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) were downloaded from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network ([RecFIN](www.recfin.org)). This survey covers the years 2004-2014, and estimates of retained plus discarded catch (catch types A and B1) were downloaded in numbers of fish as well as metric tons by year, boat mode (“PC” = party/charter, “PR”=private/rental), month, and CRFS district. In some strata, estimates of catch in numbers had no corresponding catch in weight due to missing average weight values in RecFIN. For these strata, catch in weight was estimated using the product of catch in numbers and average weight in the same year. Catches in weight (mt) were aggregated by year, boat mode, and CRFS district. As an approximation, removals in CRFS District 6 were assigned to the management area north of Cape Mendocino.

From 1980-2003, sampling of recreational fisheries in California was conducted as part of the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS). Estimates of retained and discarded catch (A+B1) in numbers of fish and weight in metric tons were downloaded from the RecFIN website. Strata with estimates of catch in numbers, but no corresponding weight, were imputed using the same approach described above for the CRFS estimates. MRFSS sampling was not conducted from 1990-1992 due to lack of funding. Also, sampling of the PC boat mode north of Point Conception did not resume until 1996. Estimates for these missing years were calculated using linear interpolation, by region and boat mode.

The MRFSS program did not provide estimates of removals stratified north and south of Cape Mendocino. However, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has maintained logbook records since 1957 of total rockfish catch by CDFW statistical block (Table \ref{tab:CA_rec_removal}) from the PC mode (a.k.a. the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel or “CPFV” fleet). Following the approach used in the last China rockfish assessment [@Cope2015], we calculated the ratio of total rockfish catch (all species combined) for statistical blocks less than 233 (blocks north of Cape Mendocino) to total rockfish catch in the area north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. latitude) by year. The ratios were then scaled such that the percentage of catch north of Mendocino in 2003 matched the observed ratio of catch in CRFS District 6 to CRFS Districts 3-6 from 2004-2011. These adjusted ratios were applied to annual MRFSS estimates for the area north of Point Conception in order to estimate landings north and south of Cape Mendocino in the years 1980-2003.

Estimates of recreational removals (catch and discard) from 1928-1979 were reconstructed by Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] (Table \ref{tab:CA_rec_removal}). Similar to the MRFSS data, the estimates produced by Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] did not partition catch to areas north and south of Cape Mendocino, so CPFV logbook data was used to determine the fraction of removals north and south of Cape Mendocino. Adjusted annual percentages (Table \ref{tab:CA_rec_removal_NS}) were applied to the reconstructed recreational catches back to 1957, and the average percentage in 1957-58 (0.74%) was applied to all previous years and assumed constant back to 1928.



###Fishery-Dependent Data: Oregon Commercial Logbook

The ODFW has required nearshore commercial fishers (both nearshore permitted vessels and open access vessels) to submit fishing logbooks since 2004.  Fisher compliance is generally high, averaging around 80%, but has varied through time ranging from 65% in 2007 to 95% in recent years.  Although required to provide all requested information in the logbook per fishing gear set, there has been substantial variation in the quantity and quality of information reported in logbooks.  Responses from submitted logbooks were entered into a central database and span the years 2004 through 2013.  At the time of this assessment, 2014 logbook submissions were not fully processed and thus were not available.  A map showing positive reports of China rockfish can be found in Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_map}.

Logbook information went through several data quality filters to attain as best as possible a consistent and representative data set through time to estimate a relative abundance trend.  Results from the filtration algorithm are summarized in Table \ref{tab:OR_commlog_sample}.  Of note, only logbook submissions from black and blue rockfish permitted vessels with a nearshore endorsement were included in the analysis, because these vessels consistently fish in areas where China rockfish are encountered.  To minimize temporal variation in reporting errors (or nuances), only vessels that fished all 10 years (2004 to 2013) were deemed the most likely to provide consistent responses through time.  Operators of endorsed vessels may have changed through time.  Individual observations of catch (kg) and effort (hook hour) were at the trip level, where multi-set trips were aggregated to the trip level.  ODFW sets bimonthly trip landing limits for China rockfish and these have changed through time.  However, trip limits have not generally been breached in the subset of logbook data used for China rockfish, and thus there was no need to exclude subsequent trips.  The final subset of logbook data included 3,575 trips (14% of the full set of logbook data) from 10 vessels (Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_sample}). 

Preliminary data analyses identified levels or limits of filtering variables in order to preserve adequate sample sizes and representative trips for China rockfish.  For example, gear type was restricted to hook-and-line (excluding longline gear) because this method accounted for 85% of all sets.  The three main southernmost Oregon ports (Port Orford, Gold Beach, and Brookings) were the only locations that included a sufficient number of sets throughout the time series for nearshore endorsed vessels.  Thus, this abundance index is most representative of southern Oregon nearshore waters. Fishing depth at the start of a set was restricted to within 30 fm (54.9 m), which included more than 99% of all sets by nearshore endorsed vessels, to ensure only CPUE in areas where China rockfish are commonly encountered was evaluated.

Covariates considered in the full model included \emph{month, vessel, port, depth, and people} (Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_pos}).  All covariates were specified as categorical variables, except depth was a continuous variable.  \emph{Depth} was included to account for general differences in bathymetry and fishing depth restrictions associated primarily with limiting catch of yelloweye rockfish.  \emph{People} were included in an attempt to control for the potential oversaturation of hooks at a given fishing location and the interaction that multi-crew trips (# fishers onboard) may have on fishing efficiency.  The selection of covariates included in final models were evaluated using standard information criterion for relative goodness of fit (AICc and BIC) in a backwards stepwise fashion, where a covariate remained in the model if model fit was improved relative to an otherwise identical model without the covariate.   

CPUE was modeled using a delta-GLM approach, where the catch occurrence (binomial) component was modeled using a logit link function and the positive catch component was modeled according to a gamma distribution with a log link function.  CPUE was calculated for each trip, where total catch was defined as the sum total of all reported retained catch (in weight) and released catch (numbers converted to weight by applying a median catch weight) and total effort was defined by hook-hours (number of hooks used multiplied by the number of hours fished).  A lognormal distribution for the positive catch component was also evaluated, but graphical summary diagnostics of model adequacy slightly favored the gamma distribution.   A delta-GLMM was also attempted to specify vessel-year interaction effects as stemming from a distribution (random effect) and to account for this added source of variation.  However, the estimation procedure was unstable for the delta-GLMM approach, resulting in overinflated CVs.    

Model selection procedures identified the covariates \emph{vessel, port, depth and people} as important, and along with the categorical \emph{year} factor of interest for the index were the variables included in both the catch occurrence and positive catch component models.  Extracted, back-transformed and bias corrected estimates of the \emph{year} effect were used for the abundance index (Table \ref{tab:OR_commlog}, Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog}).  A jackknife resampling routine was conducted to estimate the standard error (and CV) of the year effects.  The relative effects of each covariate are shown in Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_covall} for the catch occurrence component and Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_covpos} for the positive catch component.  Standard model diagnostics show adequate fit and general consistency with GLM model assumptions for the positive catch component (Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_diag}).



###Fishery-Dependent Data: Recreational Dockside Surveys

**Washington**

The WDFW provided recreational dockside fisheries data from 1981 to 2014. These data went through several data quality filters to identify the best subset of the available data that are likely to be consistent over the time series and provide a representative relative index of abundance once standardized. Sample sizes from data filtering steps prior to implementing a delta-GLM CPUE standardization resulted in 10,248 records applying the Stephens-MacCall data filter [@Stephens2004], 16,193 records applying the Stephens-MacCall data filter to the full data set and then retaining all of the positive records, and 54,285 without applying the Stephens-MacCall data filter (Table \ref{tab:WAdock_filter}). The Stephens-MacCall method is an objective approach for identifying trip records of catch and effort data when fishing locations are unknown, based inference regarding the species composition of the catch identifying habitats where the target species is likely to occur [@Stephens2004]. 

Since recreational fishing trips target a wide variety of species, standardization of the catch rates requires selecting trips that are likely to have fished in habitats containing China rockfish. The method of Stephens and MacCall [-@Stephens2004] was used to identify trips with a high probability of catching China rockfish, based on the species composition of the catch in a given trip. Prior to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative “predictor” species, i.e., those with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage (at least 30 positive trips total, distributed across at least 10 years of the index) to inform the binomial model. Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive for species which co-occur with China rockfish, and negative for species that are not caught with China rockfish. 

Covariates considered in the full model included \emph{year, month, boat type, daily bag limits, and depth restrictions} (Figure \ref{fig:WA_dock_summarySM}).  All covariates were specified as categorical variables. The stepwise selection of covariates included in the final model was evaluated using standard information criterion for relative goodness of fit (AIC). \emph{Depth} was not included in the analysis because it was not uniformly recorded through time; depth data collection began during 2003. The covariates for \emph{daily bag limits} and \emph{depth restrictions} represent management changes. Summer fishing restrictions based on depth limitations were implemented during 2006 in WDFW areas 2, 3, and 4.  The daily rockfish limit was 15 fish from 1961-1991, 12 fish from 1992-1994, and reduced to 10 fish in 1995 (see Appendix H for the history of recreational regulations, p.\pageref{sec:AppendixH}).

CPUE was modeled using a delta-GLM approach, where the catch occurrence (binomial) component was modeled using a logit link function and the positive catch component was modeled after log-transformation of the response variable, according to a normal distribution with an identity link function. Data are collected at the trip level, with the number of fish landed and the number of anglers on each vessel being recorded. The amount of time fished by each angler is not recorded. Therefore, the units for CPUE are fish landed/angler-trip. A gamma distribution for the positive catch component was also explored, but model selection favored the lognormal model, although both models provided similar results. 

Model selection procedures selected the covariates \emph{month} and \emph{boat type} as important for both the catch occurrence and positive catch component models for all data sets, along with the categorical year factor used for the index of abundance (Tables \ref{tab:WAdock_aic}, \ref{tab:WAdock_aic1} and \ref{tab:WAdock_aic2}).  A bootstrap analysis (N=500) was used to estimate the standard errors (and CVs) of the year effects (Table \ref{tab:WAdock}). Standard model diagnostics show adequate fit and general consistency with GLM model assumptions for the positive catch component Figures \ref{fig:WA_dock_diagSM}, \ref{fig:WA_dock_diagSM_retain0} and \ref{fig:WA_dock_gamma}).

Due to the large number of records filtered out by the Stephens-MacCall method three sets of models were run: 1) applying the Stephens-MacCall data filter, which eliminates both zero and positive observations, 2) applying the Stephens-MacCall data filter but retaining all of the positive records, and 3) without applying the Stephens-MacCall data filter (Table \ref{tab:WAdock_filter}). The resulting indices of China rockfish abundance using either data set subject to the Stephens-MacCall filter are similar (Figure \ref{fig:WA_dock_allindex}). However, the index resulting from the dataset not subject to the Stephens-MacCall filter produces similar trends compared to the Stephens-MacCall filter through the mid-2000s then declines compared to the indices using the Stephens-MacCall filter from the late 2000s to present (Table \ref{tab:WAdock}).  The model with the Stephens-MacCall filter that retained all positive encounters was the index selected for use in the assessment model (Figure \ref{fig:WA_dock_final}).

Additional model sensitivities that did not impact the standardized index were:  

1.The use of only area 4 data versus using all of the data with an area covariate. A strong majority of the positive data are from area 4, only these data are used in the standardized indices. 

2.Splitting the time series in 2002 to model CPUE from 2002 to 2014 as total catch (discarded fish were recorded beginning in 2002) rather than landed catch.

Producing a model for just southern areas (1 and 2) was not successful due to a lack of positive data over the time series. 



**California MRFSS Dockside Charter Boat Index, South of \boldmath{$40^\circ 10^\prime$} N. latitude** 

From 1980 to 2003 the MRFSS program sampled landings at dockside (called an “intercept”) upon termination of recreational fishing trips. The program was temporarily suspended from 1990-1992 due to lack of funding, and sampling of California charter boats north of San Luis Obispo County did not resume until 1995. For purposes of this assessment, the MRFSS time series is truncated at 2003 due to regulatory changes and an increasing fraction of trips sampled by onboard observers (see “Recreational Onboard Observer Surveys”). Although the program sampled various fishing modes, only the California party and charter boat (a.k.a. “PC mode,” commercial passenger fishing vessel, or CPFV) samples are used in the present analysis due to availability of catch and effort data aggregated at the trip level.
Each entry in the RecFIN Type 3 database corresponds to a single fish examined by a sampler at a particular survey site. Since only a subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers being interviewed. The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded. Unfortunately the Type 3 data do not indicate which records belong to the same boating trip. Because our aim is to obtain a measure of catch per unit effort (fish per angler hour), it is necessary to separate the records into individual trips. For this reason trips must be inferred from the RecFIN data. This is a lengthy process, and is outlined in Supplemental Materials (“Identifying Trips in RecFIN”).

Since recreational fishing trips target a wide variety of species, standardization of the catch rates requires selecting trips that are likely to have fished in habitats containing China rockfish. The method of Stephens and MacCall [-@Stephens2004] was used to identify trips with a high probability of catching China rockfish, based on the species composition of the catch in a given trip. Prior to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative “predictor” species, i.e., those with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage (at least 30 positive trips total, distributed across at least 10 years of the index) to inform the binomial model. Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive for species which co-occur with China rockfish, and negative for species that are not caught with China rockfish. As expected, positive indicators of China rockfish trips include several species of nearshore rockfish, and counter-indicators include several species of flatfish, salmon, and deep-water rockfish (Figure \ref{fig:MRFSS_S_SM}). One species (albacore, \emph{Thunnus alalunga}) that met the requirement of 30 positive trips over at least 10 years never co-occurred with China rockfish. All trips catching albacore were excluded from the data set used to model CPUE. Records from 1993 and 1994 were also dropped from the index, due to poor spatial coverage (all trips were in San Luis Obispo county).

The percentage of trips that caught China rockfish was 13.6% prior to filtering, and 70.8% in the final, filtered data set (n=431; Table \ref{tab:MRFSS_S_filter}).  The number of sampler-examined trips varies by year and county, and counties with small sample sizes were aggregated with adjacent counties into four \emph{regions}. (Table \ref{tab:MRFSS_S_sample_size}). Samples from Humboldt and Del Norte counties were included with the Oregon MRFSS index.

CPUE (number of fish per angler hour) was modelled using a "delta-GLM"" model [@Lo1992; @Stefansson1996]. Model selection using AIC supported inclusion of \emph{year} and \emph{region} effects in both the binomial and lognormal components of the index (Table \ref{tab:MRFSS_S_aic}). The addition of two-month \emph{wave} effects (to allow for seasonal changes in CPUE) did not improve model fit. Data in the binomial component also supported inclusion of a distance from shore variable (\emph{AREA\_X}). Residual-based model diagnostics for the positive component of the index suggest the data generally met the assumptions of the GLM (Figure \ref{fig:MRFSS_S_diag}). The resulting index  is highly variable, but suggests a decline in catch rates after 1995 relative to preceding years (Table \ref{tab:MRFSS_S_index}; Figure \ref{fig:MRFSS_S_index}).

**California North of \boldmath{$40^\circ 10^\prime$} N. latitude and Oregon Dockside Charter Boat Indices (MRFSS and ORBS)**

For the Oregon sport fisheries, three indices of abundance were used in the pre-STAR Panel base model: (1) catch rates from the onboard observer program, (2) catch rates from the dockside survey component of the ORBS, and (3) catch rates from the dockside MRFSS (see description of California MRFSS index, above).  For the onboard observer index, all data elements were verified by a biologist, and thus there was a high degree of certainty in the catch, effort, and locations fished; however, there was limited spatial-temporal coverage and only charter boats were included (not private boats).  In contrast, the ORBS dockside survey has more comprehensive coverage and much greater samples sizes (i.e., 50-70 times more trips than onboard observer program), but there was less confidence in the data elements, as only catch and the number of anglers were verified by biologists (all other trip details were angler-reported).  The two dockside programs (ORBS and MRFSS) differ in terms of the measure of fishing effort (details below). A single fishing trip can be sampled in both by the onboard observer program and also dockside within ORBS. Because the onboard observer program data is at a much finer scale than the trip-based dockside data; we removed trips from the ORBS database that were double-sampled and chose to retain all onboard observer trips.

**Index Standardization: MRFSS Dockside Charter Boat CPUE for California North of \boldmath{$40^\circ 10^\prime$} and Oregon**

An index based on MRFSS data for northern California and Oregon was developed for the pre-STAR base model. Prior to the review meeting, it was discovered that the data were not trip-level data, and the index was removed from the final base model, with negligible effect on model results. The STAT recommends that future China rockfish assessments examine trip-level MRFSS catch and effort data as a potential index of abundance. 

**Index Standardization: Oregon Recreational Boat Survey (ORBS) Dockside Charter Boat CPUE**

In order to provide estimates of total catch and effort for the Oregon sport fisheries, ORBS obtains catch rates from a portion of vessels via a dockside survey, and applies them to total effort counts.  During the dockside survey, biologists intercept vessels returning from fishing trips and record catch, effort, and other trip-related details (e.g., grid area fished, target species, depth, port, etc.).  Since catch and effort per sampled trip are both obtained, the dockside survey of ORBS was also used to develop an index of abundance for China rockfish.

Modifications had to be made to trip hours from the original ORBS dataset to create a standardized unit of effort.  Since trip hours in ORBS are not hours fished, as in MRFSS, but rather the total duration of the trip (as measured from the time the boat crossed into the ocean until the time they were interviewed at the dock), travel times had to be determined and subtracted from trip hours in order to get a standardized measure of fishing effort per trip.  Accordingly, a total distance function was created for each trip based on the river miles (distance along the navigable channel from the port to the bar (river mouth)) and ocean miles (i.e., straight distance from the river bar to the ocean grid fished, wrapping around obstructions if needed).  Total distance was then converted to travel time based on generalized vessel speeds for private (i.e., 18 mph) and charter boats (i.e., 13 mph) provided by Wayne Butler (Oregon charter captain; personal communication).  It is important to note that the original trips hours minus travel hours still does not equal hours fished because it does account for time needed to move from drift to drift; however, since the number of resets between drifts would be expected to be related to fish abundance (as with catch rates), the modified trips hours was deemed a viable effort unit for the assessment.
Some trips had erroneous trips hours (discrepancies between values entered on paper and then entered electronically later). These were the steps taken to correct the issue:

1. Trip hours is computed automatically by the data logger based on the time the interview is entered electronically 
2. If samplers write their interviews on paper and enter them electronically later when they have time (as believed to have happened despite being instructed not to), then the trip hours are inflated.
3. To potentially remove these errors, we computed time intervals between interviews.  Pulses of interviews a minute or two apart are very likely to have been from bunches of paper interviews entered at electronically in one sitting, as normal interviews are somewhat sporadic and take more than a minute to complete.

The ORBS dockside charter boat records (years 2001-2014) include 36,752 trips in the unfiltered data set, of which 4,080 caught China rockfish (11%). As with the other trip-based CPUE data sets, the Stephens-MacCall method was used to identify trips with a high probability of catching China rockfish. Prior to using the Stephens-MacCall approach to select relevant trips, a number of other filters were applied to the data to minimize variability in CPUE estimates. Criteria for valid trips included vessels with 20+ sampled trips (13% of vessels accounted for 89% of trips) and trip hours <12. Trips targeting tuna and dive trips were excluded from the analysis (see Table  \ref{tab:ORBS_filter} for other filters).

As with the MRFSS indices, potentially informative species for the Stephens-MacCall analysis were defined as those occurring in at least 30 unique trips, in 10 different years (Figure \ref{fig:ORBS_SM}). Some of these never occurred with China rockfish (strong ‘counter-indicators’) and records with these species were removed from the data prior to estimation of the index. Strong counter-indicators for the ORBS data set included blue shark, white sturgeon, steelhead, and albacore. Trips in which at least 99% of the catch consisted of pelagic rockfish were also excluded, as anglers were likely targeting semi-pelagic rockfish (Table \ref{tab:ORBS_filter}).

Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall analysis identified several rockfish species (black, rosy, tiger, bocaccio, vermilion, yelloweye, copper, etc.) as indicators of positive China rockfish catch, along with lingcod, kelp greenling, and cabezon. Counter-indicators included deep-water rockfish, salmonids, and Pacific Halibut. Brown rockfish, another nearshore rockfish species, was among the counter-indicator species, reasons for which are unclear to the STAT at this time.

A total of 6232 trips were retained following the Stephens-MacCall filter (Table \ref{tab:ORBS_sample_size}). Model selection with AIC proceeded as with the other dockside indices, but the ORBS data supported an interaction term in the lognormal component of the delta-GLM (Table \ref{tab:ORBS_aic}). The interaction was not supported by the binomial model (although AIC retained a region effect), but the keeping the year-region interaction term in the positive model reduced the AIC by 38 points over a model with year and region alone (Table \ref{tab:ORBS_aic}).

To account for this interaction, separate delta-GLM models (each with a year and wave effect) were fit to the regional data (Southern OR and Northern OR, split at Florence). The regional indices show little change in the northern region, but a decline in catch rates in the south (Figure \ref{fig:ORBS_index_compare}). Residual diagnostics for the regional models did not show strong deviations from model assumptions in either area (Figures \ref{fig:ORBS_diag_lognormal}  and \ref{fig:ORBS_diag_gamma}). Estimated area of rocky reefs off Oregon was generated using GIS (see description of onboard observer indices), and we calculated an area-weighted index based on the relative proportion of reef habitat in each region (total reef habitat distributed as 35.4% north, 64.6% south).

The final, area-weighted index (Table \ref{tab:ORBS_index}, Figure \ref{fig:ORBS_index}) shows a declining stock (on average, statewide), but the STAT emphasizes that this does not capture regional patterns in CPUE, and may underestimate the fishing impacts in the southern region, and overestimate impacts in the north.


###Fishery-Dependent Data: Recreational Onboard Observer Surveys 
The goal of the Observer Programs in California and Oregon is to collect data including charter boat fishing locations, catch and discard of observed fish by species, and lengths of discarded fish.  Both states sample the commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV), i.e., charter boat or for-hire fleet.  The onboard observer programs collect drift-specific information at each fishing stop on an observed trip.  At each fishing stop recorded information includes start and end times, start and end location (latitude/longitude), start and end depth, number of observed anglers (a subset of the total anglers), and the catch (retained and discarded) by species of the observed anglers.  Data for the onboard observer indices for the recreational CPFV fleet are from four sampling programs.  


The CDFW conducted an onboard observer program in central California from 1987-1998 (Reilly et al. 1998).  These data were previously used in the 2013 data moderate assessments [@Cope2015], at the level of a fishing trip.  Since the 2013 assessments, the original data sheets were acquired and data were keypunched to the level of fishing stop.  One caveat of this data is that location data were recorded at a finer scale than the catch data.  We aggregated the relevant location information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch information.  Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the vessel is available.  We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Appendix E for details, p.\pageref{sec:AppendixE}).  In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore excluded from the analysis.  CDFW collected lengths of both retained and discarded fish during this time period.  All China rockfish measured were retained and lengths are used as length compositions for this index.

California implemented a statewide sampling program in 1999 [@Monk2014].  California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay [@Stephens2006], but follows the protocols established in Reilly et al. [-@Reilly1998], and modified to reflect sampling changes that CDFW has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are landed instead of at the level of a fisher’s bag.  Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2014.  CalPoly collects lengths of both retained and discarded fish.  

We generated separate relative indices of abundance in California for the 1987-1999 and 2000-2014 datasets due to the number of regulation changes occurring throughout the time period (see Appendix H, p.\pageref{sec:AppendixH}).  CDFW implemented a regulation of three hooks in 2000, which was reduced to (and remains at) two hooks in 2001.

The ODFW initiated an onboard observer program in 2001, which became a yearly sampling program in 2003 [@Monk2013].  Both California and Oregon provided onboard sampling data through 2014.  Both of these programs only collected lengths of discarded fish, and the number of lengths of China rockfish from these studies is small (Figure \ref{fig:onboard_discard_lengths}).


All indices were standardized using a delta-GLM modeling approach [@Lo1992].  Data were analyzed at the drift level and catch was taken to be the sum of observed retained and discarded fish, i.e., number of fish encountered per angler hour.  The onboard observer data from the CDFW 1999-2014 data between north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude and the Oregon border were too sparse to include in the index.  Therefore, indices used in the model with a break at $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude remain the same as the state-specific onboard observer indices.


*Data Filtering*
\label{sec:onboard_datafilter}

Prior to any analyses, a preliminary data filter was applied.  

Trips/drifts from the CDFW 1988-1998 meeting the following criteria were excluded from analyses:    
1. Drift associated with a fishing location code that was not assigned to a reef    
2. Drifts identified as having possible erroneous location, observed anglers, or time data    
3. Trips encountering <50% groundfish species (number of fish)    

Trips/drifts from the ODFW, CDFW 1999-2014, and Cal Poly databases meeting the following criteria were excluded from analyses:    
1. ODFW halibut-targeted trips were excluded  
2. Drifts south of Pt. Conception (only 2 China rockfish observed south of Pt. Conception)
3. Trips encountering <50% groundfish species     
4. Drifts within the current Stonewall Bank Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation      
5. Drifts within Arcata Bay, Humboldt Bay, South Bay, or San Francisco Bay      
6. Drifts missing a starting location (latitude/longitude)      
7. Drifts identified as having possible erroneous location or time data     
8. Drifts missing both starting and ending depths       
9. Drifts within the habitat data occurring farther than 83 m from a reef in Oregon and 34 m in California (see Appendix F (p. \pageref{sec:AppendixF}) for details)      
10.	Drifts outside the habitat data in California occurring farther than 141 m from reef (see Appendix F (p. \pageref{sec:AppendixF}) for details)     
11.	Drifts occurring on a reef with <3 positive encounters of China rockfish      
12.	Drifts occurring on a reef in which China rockfish was observed in <25% of years the reef was visited         



**Index standardization: Oregon**

At the March 2015 Nearshore Stock Assessments Workshop the issue of hook saturation by black rockfish (\emph{Sebastes melanops}) in Oregon was raised ([Agenda Item D.8 Attachment 10](http://tinyurl.com/ndrrx9r), June 2015).  The recreational fishery in Oregon specifically targets black rockfish.  While black rockfish associate with rocky habitat, they are a schooling, midwater species.  Fishermen specifically targeting black rockfish may not drop their lines to the seafloor, or may encounter black rockfish and other midwater species before their lines can reach the seafloor.  To address this issue in the onboard observer data, we filtered out drifts for which the catch (retained plus discarded) consisted of at least 95\% black, blue (\emph{Sebastes mystinus}) and yellowtail (\emph{Sebastes flavidus}) rockfishes, the most commonly occurring midwater rockfish species.  This resulted in a decrease in the number of drifts by 4,092, only three of which observed China rockfish.  

The filtered dataset included 6,038 drifts, of which 259 (4%) drifts with positive encounters (Table \ref{tab:Onboard_filter}).  The majority of drifts sampled (75%) were from north of Florence, although China rockfish were present in 6% of drifts in southern Oregon and 3% of drifts in the north. 
Covariates considered in the full model included \emph{year, depth, month or 2-month wave} and, \emph{region} (Figures \ref{fig:OR_onboard_summary} and \ref{fig:OR_onboard_CPAH}). To increase sample sizes data from waves 2 and 3 were aggregated as well as from 4 and 5 (ODFW does not sample in waves 1 and 6).  Depths greater than 20 m were also binned to 20-59 m.

The final selected dataset contained categorical variables for \emph{year} (13 levels), \emph{wave} (2 levels), \emph{region} (2 levels, north and south of Florence), and three depth bins (\emph{depth}: 0-19 m, and 20-59 m). A lognormal model was selected over a gamma for the positive encounters by a deltaAIC of 20.01. Model selection, using AIC, selected a lognormal model with \emph{year, wave, depth, region}, and a \emph{wave:depth} interaction, while a binomial with \emph{year, region}, and \emph{wave} was selected (Table \ref{tab:OR_onboard_aic}).  In the lognormal submodel, stepwise BIC retained the \emph{year}. In the binomial model, stepwise BIC retained \emph{region} and \emph{wave}. The final \emph{year} effects from the delta-GLM with main effects \emph{year, region}, and \emph{wave} are shown in Table \ref{tab:OR_onboard} and Figure \ref{fig:OR_onboard}). The final model suggests that relative abundance was slightly higher in southern Oregon, and in waves 4 and 5.   Standard model diagnostics show adequate fit and general consistency with GLM model assumptions for the positive catch component (Figure \ref{fig:OR_onboard_diag}).

**Index standardization: California**

*Central California 1988-1998*

The filtered dataset included 5,557 drifts, of which 852 (15%) drifts with positive encounters (Table \ref{tab:Onboard_filter}). To increase sample sizes, data from Regions 2 and 3 were aggregated as well as Regions 8 and 9.  Samples north of Ten Mile River were too sparse to reliably include in the index.

Covariates considered in the full model included \emph{year, depth, month or 2-month wave} and, \emph{region} (Figures \ref{fig:prehist_onboard_summary} and \ref{fig:prehist_onboard_CPAH}).  The selected data contained categorical variables for \emph{year} (13 levels), \emph{wave} (6 levels), \emph{region} (5 levels), and four depth bins (\emph{depth}: 0-19 m, 20-39 m, 40-59 m, and 60-79 m). A lognormal model was selected over a gamma for the positive encounters by a deltaAIC of 125.06. Model selection, using AIC, selected a lognormal model with \emph{year, depth, and region}, while a binomial with \emph{year, region, depth, wave}, and a \emph{year:region} interaction was selected.  However, the standard errors of the binomial model with interactions were large, and suggested data were too sparse to explore the \emph{year:region} interaction.  For the lognormal submodel, stepwise BIC retained the \emph{depth} and \emph{region} (Table \ref{tab:prehist_onboard_aic}). For the binomial submodel, stepwise BIC retained \emph{year, region}, and \emph{depth}. The final \emph{year} effects from the delta-GLM with main effects \emph{year, region}, and \emph{depth} are shown in Table \ref{tab:prehist_onboard} and Figure \ref{fig:prehist_onboard}).  The covariates in the final model suggest the relative abundance of China rockfish decreases with depth and increases north of Monterey, CA.  Standard model diagnostics show adequate fit and general consistency with GLM model assumptions for the positive catch component (Figure \ref{fig:prehist_onboard_diag})


*California (north of Pt. Conception) 2000-2014*

The filtered dataset included 13,993 drifts, of which 1,403 (10\%) drifts with positive encounters (Table \ref{tab:Onboard_filter}).  CDFW began sampling Region 12 (Trinidad Head to the OR border) in 2008 and no trips from Region 11 (Cape Mendocino to the Eel River) were sampled from 2000-2014.  From 2008-2014, only 10 drifts encountering China rockfish were observed in Region 12.  Therefore, the following index only reflects the population south of Cape Mendocino.  Further, to increase sample sizes drifts from Regions 2 and 3 were aggregated as well as Regions 7 and 8, and Regions 9 and 10.

Covariates considered in the full model included \emph{year, depth, month or 2-month wave} and, \emph{region} (Figures \ref{fig:CA_onboard_summary} and \ref{fig:CA_onboard_CPAH}).  The selected data contained categorical variables for \emph{year} (15 levels), \emph{wave} (6 levels), \emph{region} (6 levels), and four depth bins (\emph{depth}: 0-19 m, 20-39 m, 40-59 m, and 60-79 m). A lognormal model was selected over a gamma for the positive encounters by a deltaAIC of 115.91. Model selection, using AIC, selected a lognormal model with \emph{year, depth, and region}, while a binomial with \emph{year, region, depth}, and a \emph{year:region} interaction was selected.  However, the standard errors of the binomial model with interactions were large, and suggested data were too sparse to explore the \emph{year:region} interaction.  For the lognormal submodel, stepwise BIC retained the \emph{year} and \emph{region} (Table \ref{tab:CA_onboard_aic}). For the binomial submodel, stepwise BIC retained \emph{region}, and \emph{depth}. The final \emph{YEAR} effects from the delta-GLM with main effects \emph{year, region}, and \emph{depth} are shown in Table \ref{tab:CA_onboard} and Figure \ref{fig:CA_onboard}).  The covariates in the final model suggest the relative abundance of China rockfish decreases with depth, specifically in depths greater than 59 m, and increases south to north.  Standard model diagnostics show adequate fit and general consistency with GLM model assumptions for the positive catch component (Figure \ref{fig:CA_onboard_diag})


###Fishery-Independent Data: sources considered, but not used in assessment
 *Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) slope survey*    
The NWFSC slope survey was conducted annually from 1999 to 2002.  The depth range of this survey (100-700 fm) is outside the depth range of China rockfish, and was therefore not used in this assessment.    

*Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) shelf-slope survey*     
This survey is referred to as the “combo,” conducted annually since 2003.  The survey consistently covered depths between 30 and 700 fm, and has never encountered a China rockfish.  Therefore, the combo survey was not used in this assessment.

*Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) shelf survey*     
The survey, often referred to as the “triennial” survey was conducted every third year between 1977 and (and conducted in 2004 by the NWFSC using the same protocols).  The triennial survey trawls in depths (generally 30 to 275 fm) that are deeper the range and habitats of China rockfish, and was therefore not used in this assessment.

*Pikitch study*    
The Pikitch study was conducted between 1985 and 1987 [@Pikitch1988].  The northern and southern boundaries of the study were $48^\circ 42^\prime$ N latitude and $42^\circ 60^\prime$ N. latitude respectively, which is primarily within the Columbia INPFC area [@Pikitch1988; @Rogers1992].  Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears.  Observers of normal fishing operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample.  China rockfish are not targeted using trawl gear, and therefore we did not use data from this survey in the assessment.
 
*Enhanced Data Collection Project (EDCP)*       
The EDCP was conducted by ODFW to collect information on bycatch and discard groundfish species off the coast of Oregon from late 1995 to early 1999.  EDCP had limited spatial coverage in Oregon waters only.  China rockfish are not targeted using trawl gear, and therefore we did not use data from this survey in the assessment.

*Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)*       
A total of 59 China rockfish were observed in 17,657 SCUBA transects conducted in the southern and central survey regions. Transects were conducted in Northern California and Oregon for two years (2010-2011), with a higher occurrence of China rockfish (156 out of 956 transects).

\end{itemize}


*Recreational: Washington (WDFW)*

Recreational length- and age- composition data were provided directly from WDFW during winter 2015. The WDFW routinely collected recreational biological samples for China rockfish between 1995 and 2014, with all but one year sampled during 1979 to 1983. These composition data lack information on the number of fish sampled out of those landed in a given trip, and therefore are used without expansion to the sample level. Unexpanded recreational composition data are frequently used in West Coast stock assessments for the above reason. Length and age data collected from dockside recreational samples WA are summarized by the number of fish sampled (Table \ref{tab:WA_FishD_bio}). The WA recreational length- and age- compositions are shown in Figures \ref{fig:N_comp_lendat_flt1mkt2}, \ref{fig:N_comp_lendat_flt3mkt2}, and \ref{fig:N_comp_condAALdat_bubflt3mkt2}.

*Recreational: California MRFSS and CRFS length composition data*

Individual fish lengths recorded by MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS (2004-2011) samplers were downloaded from the RecFIN website (www.recfin.org). CRFS data from 2012-2014 were obtained directly from CDFW. Fish were assigned to the northern and southern management areas based on county and interview site number. To examine finer scale spatial differences in size composition data, interview sites in each county were assigned to a CRFS district (including years prior to 2004). Distributions of lengths increased from south to north, with the largest change in mean length occurring between CRFS districts 5 & 6 (roughly around Cape Mendocino;  Figure \ref{fig:S_CDFW_length_comps_by_district_1980-2014}). This pattern was consistent across all years of CRFS sampling (2004-2014; Figure \ref{fig:S_CDFW_length_comps_by_year+district_2004-2014}). Sizes of retained fish north of Cape Mendocino were more similar to fish caught in Oregon than fish caught south of Cape Mendocino. Since both biological (e.g. growth) and fishery-related (e.g. selectivity, retention) factors can influence the size compositions, length at age was estimated internal to the assessment models in all three areas.

*Recreational: Oregon Recreational Boat Survey (ORBS)*

Biological data from the ORBS program were provided by ODFW.  The ORBS is a dockside sampling program for the both the recreational CPFV and private modes.  Length composition samples from north of Florence for the CPFV and private fleets were provided from 1980-2014.  Samples from south of Florence spanned 1984-2014. Distributions of length data from these southern and northern parts of Oregon were similar to each other, and across years (Figure \ref{fig:ORBS_length_dists_by_region_and_year}).


*Recreational: Miller and Gotshall [-@Miller1965]*      
The Northern California Marine Sport Fish Survey conducted an assessment survey with goals that included estimation of annual fishing effort by all recreational fishing modes, catch by weight, CPUE, and collection of  data to analyze length compositions.  Lengths from 101 China rockfish were collected from 1959-1960. Lengths of China rockfish from 1959 primarily came from private/rental boats, and lengths from 1960 came from charter boats. These two years of data were not consistent with length composition data from later years, and were influential on model results (see model sensitivities to these data).

*Commercial: PacFIN (Oregon and California)*

Biological data from commercial fisheries for China rockfish were extracted from PacFIN (PSMFC) on May 18, 2015. Commercial landings and the biological characteristics of hook-and-line landings were sampled from 1995-2014 in Oregon and in 1991-2013 California. There is no commercial catch of China rockfish in the state of Washington. Currently, port biologists employed by each state fishery agency collect species-composition information and biological data from the landed catches. The monitoring programs currently in place vary between the states but are generally based on stratified, multistage sampling designs. The OR data were available by live fish fishery landings and dead fish fishery landings, but fish conditions were not available for PacFIN for the CA landings. Due to the lack of fish condition data for CA in PacFIN, the CA commercial fishery compositions were downloaded from the [CALCOM](http://128.114.3.187/) database.

Annual commercial length- and age-frequency distributions were developed for each state for which observations were available, following the same bin structure as was used for research observations. For each fleet, the raw observations were expanded to the sample level, to allow for any fish that were not measured, then to the trip level to account for the relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained. Length and age data collected from commercial landings for OR and CA are summarized by the number of port samples (Tables \ref{tab:OR_pacfin_bio} and \ref{tab:CA_calcom_bio}). Figures \ref{fig:C_comp_lendat_flt5mkt2}, \ref{fig:C_comp_lendat_flt6mkt2}, \ref{fig:C_comp_lendat_sex1mkt2_page1_multi-fleet_comparison}, \ref{fig:C_comp_lendat_sex1mkt2_page2_multi-fleet_comparison}, \ref{fig:C_comp_condAALdat_bubflt5mkt2}, and \ref{fig:C_comp_condAALdat_bubflt7mkt2} show plots of the commercial length and age composition data for the central model.  Figures \ref{fig:S_comp_lendat_flt1mkt2}, \ref{fig:S_comp_lendat_flt5mkt2}, and \ref{fig:S_comp_lendat_flt2mkt2} show plots of the commercial length and age composition data for the southern model.


*Research: NMFS groundfish ecology survey*      

From 2001-2005, the SWFSC Fisheries Ecology Division conducted longline surveys aboard a chartered commercial longline vessel at various stations between Monterey and Davenport, CA ($36^\circ$ N. latitude to $37.5^\circ$ N. latitude) (pers. comm. Don Pearson, SWFSC). Longline gear was set in various depths from 10 meters to 700 meters, parallel to the depth contour.  Each longline set consisted of 3-5 skates, each with about 250 2/0 circle hooks baited with squid.  In nearshore habitats, we allowed the gear to soak for roughly 30 minutes.  A small number of China rockfish length samples were available from this cruise, but were not included in the assessments due to sample size and potential differences in selectivity.

*Research: California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP)*

The [California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program](https://seagrant.mlml.calstate.edu/research/ccfrp/) (CCFRP), created by Rick Starr (Sea Grant and Moss Landing Marine Laboratory) and Dean Wendt (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo), monitors marine protected areas (MPAs) and gathers information useful for fisheries management [@Starr2015].  This program has been running in Central California since 2007.  Length compositions for China rockfish were included in this assessment (Figure \ref{fig:S_comp_lendat_flt8mkt0}).

Future research is planned to use CPUE information from this program, comparing relative abundance indices derived from fishery-dependent and fishery-independent monitoring programs. The CCFRP data provide a time series of fishery-independent catch and effort at fixed stations, collecting information at sample sites inside and outside of MPAs spanning about 200 miles of the California coast from Point Buchon to $\text{A\~{n}o}$ Nuevo.  This fishery-independent information, combined with our current fishery-dependent information (i.e., CPFV onboard observer data), provides an opportunity for fine-scale spatial and temporal analysis of catch rates and species compositions, specifically addressing the research needs identified in nearshore rockfish stock assessments.


*Research: Abrams Thesis*

Jeff Abrams [-@Abrams2014] conducted a research study aboard recreational charter boats from Crescent City Harbor, Trinidad Bay and the Noyo River Harbor.  Rocky habitat was identified from high resolution bathymetric data and gridded into 500 m by 500 m cells (California Seafloor Mapping Project, data available from: http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html).  During a sampling event, cells were randomly selected to fish.  Fish were captured via hook-and-line by either researchers, students, or recreational fishers.  The charter boat captain was not allowed to search and target fish within the cell.  Fishing drifts started at the up-current/wind side of the cell and drifted to the opposite edge of the cell, then stopped the clock and reset for another drift (Jeff Abrams, pers. comm.)  If it was certain that fishing was occurring over sand, the captain would generally reset. However, because cells were selected with a minimum area of rocky habitat, this was rare.  This studied provided 138 individual China rockfish, which were used as Conditional Age-at-Length (CAAL) in the southern model (Figure \ref{fig:S_comp_condAALdat_bubflt9mkt0}).


###Biological Data: Age structures
Age structure data were available from the following sources:

_Southern model (California south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude)_ 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,topsep=0pt]
  \item Jeff Abrams’ thesis (\emph{research},2010-2011)
  \item CDFW (\emph{recreational and research}, 1972-1985)
  \item CDFW (\emph{recreational CPFV}, 1977-1986)
  \item CDFW (\emph{recreational CPFV}, 1980-1984)
  \item NMFS groundfish ecology (\emph{research}, 2003-2005)
\end{itemize}

_Central model (California north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude to the OR/WA border)_  
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,topsep=0pt]
  \item Oregon, majority south of Florence (\emph{commercial dead landings}, 2001-2013)
  \item Oregon, north of Florence (\emph{recreational, all modes combined}, 2005-2013)
  \item Oregon, south of Florence (\emph{recreational, all modes combined}, 2005-2013)
\end{itemize}

_Northern model (Washington state MCAs 1-4)_
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,topsep=0pt]
  \item Washington South (MCAs 1-2, \emph{recreational, all modes combined}, 2014)
  \item Washington North (MCAs 3-4,\emph{recreational, all modes combined}, 1998-2014)
\end{itemize}

The commercial ages from Oregon were extracted from PacFIN, and these data are uploaded by the states. The Washington state ages were provided by Tien-Shui Tsou (pers. comm.) and aged by WDFW.  Otoliths from various CDFW sampling programs (1972-1985) were aged for this assessment. It is unclear whether the otoliths were obtained from recreational boat modes, research cruises, and diving modes. For this reason, these ages were not included in the assessment models, but were used for external estimation of size at age.  Commercial port samplers in California sampled catch from recreational charter boats in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

A total of 3,963 fish were aged/re-aged for this assessment (Table \ref{tab:growth_sample_size}), very few  of which were small or young fish (Figure \ref{fig:age_length_raw_state}). Prior to this assessment, the only available growth curve for China rockfish was estimated from Lea et al. [-@Lea1999].  Lea et al. [-@Lea1999] aged China rockfish via the surface aging method.  Surface ages are biased towards younger ages; the break-and-burn method is preferred and more precise [@Beamish1979; @Kimura1979].  All ages for this assessment were aged using the break-and-burn method, either by WDFW or the NMFS NWFSC Aging Lab.

Length-at-age was initially estimated external to the population dynamics models using the von Bertalanffy growth curve [@vonB1938], $L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in years, $k$ is rate of increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ is the asymptotic length.  The unavailability of small fish results in unrealistic estimates of $t_0$, on the order of -9 to -20 depending on the subset of data modeled.  For exploratory purposes, $t_0$ was fixed at 0, and for final estimates of growth the length of age-0 fish was fixed at 2 cm.  The NMFS SWFSC conducts an annual rockfish recruitment and ecosystem assessment survey.  Pelagic juvenile rockfish are collected at an average age of approximately 100 days. The mean size of all rockfish species at 1 month of age was roughly 2 cm.  At this age, length-at-age is fairly consistent among species and therefore differences in growth among species are unlikely to introduce considerable bias. We approximated size-at-age zero in the assessment with a value of 2 cm.

Differences in growth between sexes, among fleets, and regions were explored. To remove biases introduced by region or fleet, we used data from the southern Oregon (south of Florence, OR) commercial (dead fish) fleet to look at the growth difference between males and females.  Few fish were aged older than 37 years (5.8\%).  For ages in which there were fish aged older than 37 years, there was only one fish in each age. Including these fish in the model proved to bias the von Bertalanffy growth estimates (large (>1.5) standard errors in estimates of $L_{\infty}$).  Therefore, the following exploratory analyses exclude fish older than 37 years.  Fixing $t_0$ at 0, the other parameters for males and females were similar and the differences were not biologically significant,  (Males: $L_{\infty}=37.14, k=0.21$; Females: $L_{\infty}=35.91, k=0.23$).  This result, estimating males having a larger asymptotic size of approximately 1 cm than females, is anomalous, as females are larger than males in all but one rockfish species [@Love2002].  This is also inconsistent with the analysis of Lenarz and Echeverria [-@Lenarz1991], which identified no significant sexually dimorphic characters in China rockfish.  Quillback rockfish (\emph{Sebastes maliger}, also in the \emph{Pteropdus} subgenus) are also long-lived and don't exhibit dimorphic growth until approximately age 30, with an estimated $L_{\infty}$ of 0.5 cm greater for females than males [@Love2002].  Given the sparse data for older China rockfish and the unlikelihood of China rockfish being the only rockfish species where males are larger than females, growth is assumed the same for males and females in this assessment.

Using data from southern Oregon (south of Florence, OR), differences in growth among the commercial (dead fish) and the private recreational fleets were explored.  There were significant differences in growth between the fleets (Commercial: $L_{\infty}=36.23, k=0.22$; Recreational: $L_{\infty}=37.93, k=0.22$), suggesting differing selectivity between the fleets.  The commercial fleet has been restricted to a 12 in minimum size limit since 2000, with a preference for plate-sized fish.  All of the age data from the southern Oregon commercial (dead fish) fleet are from 2001-2013.  The recreational fleet has no minimum size limit and all samples are from 2005-2013. 

Regional differences in growth were significant.  In general, the asymptotic size of fish were smallest in southern California (south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude), increased in northern California (north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude) to southern Washington (MCAs 1 & 2) and decreased again in northern Washington (Table \ref{tab:growth_params} and Figure \ref{fig:age_length_region}).  

Stock Synthesis models growth as the Schnute parameterization of the von Bertalanffy growth model.  The size of fish at age-0 was fixed at 2 cm with a CV of 0.1, and all other parameters estimated within the model.

###Biological Data: Aging precision and bias
Ageing imprecision was estimated using a collection of 529 China rockfish otoliths with multiple age reads (Figures \ref{fig:age_error1} - \ref{fig:age_error3}). We analyzed this data set using the ageing error software provided by Andre Punt and Jim Thorson, publicly available at https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscAgeingError. The software estimated a bias in the age readings from some early samples read by a former NWFSC age reader and these were excluded from the compositions used in the model. The variability in age readings of the remaining readers was estimated under an assumption of a linear increase in standard deviation with age. The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings increasing from 0.1 years at age 1 by about 1 year of uncertainty per 10 years of age to a standard deviation of 7.7 years at age 80.

###Biological Data: Weight-Length
The weight-length relationship is based on the standard power function: $W = \alpha(L^\beta)$ where $W$ is individual weight (kg), $L$ is length (cm), and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coefficients used as constants.

This assessment uses weight-length parameters for females of $\alpha=1.17x10^{-5}$ and $\beta=3.177$, derived from Lea et al. [-@Lea1999].  A fit of the length-weight relationship to the Oregon ORBS data, $\alpha=2.06x10^{-5}$ and $\beta=3.02$,  yielded a curve that was very similar to that reported in Lea et al. [-@Lea1999] (Figure \ref{fig:weight_length}).


###Biological Data: Maturity and Fecundity
China rockfish maturity-at-length data were sparse and was gathered from two available sources, one from California and one from Oregon.  Echeverria [-@Echeverria1987] collected 69 China rockfish from central and northern California, of which the age at first maturity was 3 years for males and females (26 cm).  Both males and females exhibited 50% maturity at 4 years (27 cm) and 100% maturity at 6 years (30 cm).  

In Oregon, Hannah and Blume [-@Hannah2011] determined a length at 50% maturity at 28.5 cm from a sample size of 239 China rockfish.  Maturity was fit to a logistic curve,  $p_l = \frac{e^{B_0+{B_l}^1}}{1+e^{{B_0}+{B_l}^1}}$, where $p_l$ is the proportion of the natural fish at length $l$, and $B_0$ and $B_1$ are the regression coefficients.  Parameter estimates from Hannah and Blume [-@Hannah2011] are $B_0 = -13.320$ and $B_1 = 0.467$.

The southern base model used the California estimate (50% mature at 27cm) while the central and northern draft based models used the Oregon estimate (50% mature at 28.5 cm).  Fecundity is assumed proportional to female spawning biomass in the draft base models.

###Biological Data: Natural Mortality
Natural mortality for wild fish populations is extremely difficult to estimate.  

Dick and MacCall [-@Dick2010] estimated natural mortality for 50 data poor stocks using Hoenig's [-@Hoenig1983] method.  The total mortality rate ($Z$, the sum of natural and fishing mortality rates), is estimated as, $log(Z) = 1.710 - 1.084log(A_{max})$, where $A_{max}$ is the maximum observed age.  The mortality rate was back-transformed to arithmetic space using a bias correction factor, log-scale standard deviation of 0.4.

Cope et al. [-@Cope2015] used the maximum age for China rockfish of 79 years in the 2013 data moderate assessment, which produces a natural mortality rate of 0.055. The maximum age of China rockfish on the West Coast is now 83 years (age data for this assessment), which gives a natural mortality of 0.056 when calculated from Hoenig's method.

###Biological Data: Sex ratios
The sex ratio from all of the aged China rockfish for this assessment were approximately 50% each males and females (WA: 47\%, OR: 47\%, and CA: 49\% female).  These fishes came from a mixture of recreational, commercial, and research collections.  




##History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock

###Previous assessments
Dick and MacCall [-@Dick2010] estimated the overfishing level (OFL) for China, which was adopted for the PFMC’s 2011-12 and 2013-14 management cycles, as components of the stock complex OFLs associated with each species.  

China rockfish was assessed as a data moderate species in 2013 [@Cope2015].  The accepted assessment modelled removal and index data using Extended Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (XDB-SRA)  [@Dick2011], which is a Bayesian surplus production model reparameterized in terms of MacCall’s [-@MacCall2009] Depletion-Corrected Average Catch method.  The STAR panel favored regional models for China rockfish, north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude.  

The stock north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude was found to be below target biomass, as a percentage of unfished biomass (a.k.a. “depletion”), but above the minimum stock size threshold (MSST).  The median of the posterior northern spawning biomass in 2013 was estimated at 37\% (84 mt), and the fishing mortality rate in 2012 was 21.5\% of $F_{MSY.}$  

The stock south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude was found to be above target biomass, as a percentage of unfished biomass (a.k.a. “depletion”).  The median of the posterior southern spawning biomass in 2013 was estimated at 66\% (264 mt), and the fishing mortality rate in 2012 was 27\% of $F_{MSY.}$

###Spatial stock structure

The waters and biological communities of the California Current System tend to exhibit the greatest change at the major promontories along the West Coast, including Point Conception, Cape Mendocino, Cape Blanco and the northern tip of Vancouver Island (@Checkley2009; @Hickey1979; @Gottscho2014).  In particular, the waters off Cape Mendocino are a known biogeographical boundary along the West Coast of the U.S. and has been shown as a geographical boundary across a number of terrestrial and marine taxa (see Gottscho [-@Gottscho2014] for a review).   The waters off Cape Mendocino, CA are characterized by turbulent waters and some of the strongest winds and upwelling found within the California Current [@Botsford2002; @PFMC2013].

The California Current is the equatorward surface flow that extends from the Vancouver Island, Canada (approx. $50^\circ$ N. latitude) with equatorward flow to Baja California, Mexico (approx. $15^\circ - 25^\circ$ N. latitude) [@Hickey1979; @Checkley2009].  Winds associated with the North Pacific High, the Aleutian Low, and a thermal low-pressure system drive the oceanographic dynamics that stretch from central California to northern Mexico [@Checkley2009].  Seasonal winds drive the frequency and intensity of upwelling along the coast.  Off the coast of Washington south to Cape Blanco, OR the winds and therefore upwelling is generally weak.  Starting near Cape Blanco, OR the continental shelf narrows and winds and upwelling intensity increases [@Francis2009].  The winter environment south of Cape Mendocino is dominated by upwelling from southerly winds pushing water offshore through Ekman transport, whereas northward winds north of Cape Mendocino result in downwelling.  Summer upwelling is dominant along the entire West Coast of the US from the northerly winds pushing the surface waters offshore via Ekman transport.  South of Cape Mendocino upwelling conditions persist all year, with the northerly winds strongest from April-June.  North of Cape Mendocino a low pressure system in the Gulf of Alaska produces westerly and southwesterly winds that blow surface waters towards shore and result in downwelling.

In addition to the oceanic conditions in the California Current, there is also a prominent submarine ridge off the coast of Cape Mendocino. The Mendocino Escarpment, a submarine ridge extending past the 200 nm EEZ boundary, is a dominant physical feature in the California Current [@Fisk1993].  Currents from the north and south converge around the Mendocino Escarpment creating an area of offshore transport, which may create a physical barrier to larval dispersal [@Magnell1990; @Cope2004; @Sivasundar2010].

Gottscho [-@Gottscho2014] completed a comprehensive review of the zoogeography literature worldwide and identified both Cape Mendocino and Point Conception as phylogeographic breakpoints on the West Coast.  Specifically, coastal Oregon does not experience the intense upwelling and offshore transport as off the California coast south of Cape Mendocino, which allows increased larval retention in nearshore waters in Oregon [@Gottscho2014].  Drake [-@Drake2013] used simulation modelling to evaluate dispersal of spring spawning nearshore invertebrates and found that larval dispersal ranged from 175 km to 200 km from the release site (Bodega Bay, CA) when larvae remained below the surface boundary layer, allowing larvae to avoid offshore drifts.  Larval retention in nearshore waters in California may be driven by the timing of relaxed upwelling and the ability of larvae to remain below the surface boundary layer [@Sivasundar2010; @Drake2013].  In simulations, larval dispersal ranged from 175 km to 200 km from the release site (Bodega Bay, CA) when larvae remained below the surface boundary layer, which allows larvae to avoid offshore advection [@Drake2013].  The majority of drifters released off the coast of Oregon (Newport and Coos Bay) from 1994-1999 remained north of Cape Mendocino within the first 40 days of deployment and none returned to coastal waters south of Point Arena, CA [@Sotka2004].  Trajectories of comparative drifters released in off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA never overlapped with the drifters released in Oregon.  

Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino have both been shown as transition zones to juvenile and adult fishes.  Field and Ralston [-@Field2005] utilized landings and age data to elucidate year-class strength among a number of rockfish species along the West Coast.  Spatial patterns in recruitment were heightened in vicinity Cape Mendocino and Cape Blanco versus comparison between regions further from these capes.  Characterization of species assemblages in two of the trawl surveys conducted by the NMFS have also shown shifts around Cape Mendocino.  Tolimieri [-@Tolimieri2006] found a shift in the species assemblage captured in the NMFS slope trawl survey near both Point Conception Cape Mendocino, CA and Cape Blanco, OR.  The AFSC triennial shelf trawl surveys indicate a change in distribution around the Mendocino Escarpment; with the Mendocino Escarpment acting as a physical barrier to some species, e.g., blackgill rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, chilipepper, shortbelly rockfish, bocaccio, and greenspotted rockfish [@Williams2002].

In addition to analyzing fisheries catch and survey trawl data, results from recent genetic studies of rockfish along the West Coast vary from finding genetic divergence along the coast to finding little evidence of genetic divergence along the coast.  Genetic studies of blue rockfish, a nearshore midwater species with schooling tendency, show the species to have a genetic break around Cape Mendocino, CA [@Cope2004; @Burford2008].  A study by Sivasundar and Palumbi [-@Sivasundar2010] confirmed a genetic differentiation of blue rockfish between Oregon and Monterey, CA, with yellowtail rockfish exhibiting the same strong genetic differentiation.  While Sivasundar and Palumbi [-@Sivasundar2010] did not specifically look at China rockfish, the \emph{Pteropodus} subgenus was represented by copper, gopher and brown rockfishes, all three of which exhibited only moderate genetic differentiation along the coast.  Additional genetic studies of copper, grass and brown rockfishes indicate limited larval dispersal and increasing genetic divergence with increasing geographic distance [@Buonaccorsi2002; @Buonaccorsi2004; Buonaccorsi unpubl. data].  Much additional work is needed to fully understand the genetic differentiation of rockfish species along the west coast.  However, these studies support the hypotheses that oceanographic and physical barriers are likely to limit larval dispersal along the coast.

California has managed the area from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon/California border as its own management area since 2000 (see Appendices G and H for details).  The Pacific Fishery Management Council developed a Pacific Coast Fishery Ecosystem Plan in which the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem and recognizes the transitional zone between Cape Blanco, OR and Cape Mendocino, CA  [@Francis2009; @PFMC2013]. 

The 2013 stock assessment of China rockfish consisted of two, independent models, north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude. Following the STAR panel, a request was made to stratify the assessment north and south of $42^\circ$ N. latitude (the CA-OR border), based on concerns over spatial differences in exploitation history and insufficient trend data between $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude and $42^\circ$ N. latitude ([Agenda Item F.5.b Supplemental GMT Report](http://www.pcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/F5b_SUP_GMT_JUN2013BB.pdf), June 2013). In November 2013, after examining results from both area stratifications, the SSC concluded that there was no evidence in support of either stratification, and recommended that the Council retain the model stratified around the existing management boundary ([Agenda Item H.5.b Supplemental SSC Report](http://www.pcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/H5b_SUP_SSC_RPT_NOV2013BB.pdf), November 2013).

The 2013 China rockfish assessment was a data-moderate assessment and therefore did not consider size and age composition data as part of the analysis. For this assessment, the STAT made efforts to examine all available data sources that might provide evidence of spatial stock structure. Data sets with sufficient sample sizes and spatial coverage included length frequency and length at age data.

The largest source of length composition data came from the recreational fleets in each state. In California, the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) has collected length data by CRFS district since 2004. Distributions of length for sampled (retained) catch varied by district, with mean length smallest in the southernmost district with adequate samples (CFRS District 3), and largest in the northernmost district, CRFS District 6, roughly the area between Cape Mendocino and the California-Oregon border (Figure \ref{fig:S_CDFW_length_comps_by_year+district_2004-2014}). There is some indication of a gradient in average length of retained fish, but the largest increase in mean length between adjacent CRFS Districts occurs between CFRS Districts 5 & 6 (roughly across Cape Mendocino).

Since length compositions of retained fish are affected by numerous processes (e.g., growth, recruitment, exploitation, selectivity), the STAT also compared growth curves fit to size at age data. External fits indicated differences in growth among regions, and these patterns were consistent with growth curves estimated within the assessment models (see base model results for details).

The stock was split at $40^circ 10^prime$ base on the following evidence, 1)  it is a zoogeographic boundary, 2) growth is more similar north and south of this boundary, with a jump at the boundary, and 3) the northern California area is remote from California population centers, and likely has a history of fishery development more similar to southern Oregon than south of Cape Mendocino.

The stock was split at the Oregon and Washington border, supported by 1) differential external and internal model fits to growth, 2) different exploitation histories between the two states, e.g., Washington does not have a commercial fishery, and,  3) latitudinal differences in the length compositions.


###2013 Data Moderate Recommendations

\begin{description}[style=unboxed]

  \item[Recommendation 1: Continued research on the uncertainty in the catch histories of all groundfishes.  Reconstructions of historical catches are still needed for certain areas, time periods, and fisheries. Currently, reconstructed catches are available for California’s commercial and recreational fisheries extending back to 1916 and 1928, respectively (Ralston et al. 2010). Oregon has completed a reconstruction for its commercial catch since 1876 (V. Gertseva, NMFS; pers. comm.), but recreational catch prior to 1980 is assumed to be zero in this analysis. Recreational catch in Washington was reconstructed to 1975 for these assessments, and interpolated back to 1960. A thorough reconstruction of historical commercial catches (prior to 1981) is urgently needed for Washington. Estimates of uncertainty in historical catch reconstructions are needed for all states.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: Oregon completed a reconstruction of the  recreational catches back to 1973. There is currently no reconstruction of the commercial catches in Washington, and no estimates of uncertainty are available for any catch reconstruction.

\item[Recommendation 2: Single-species stock assessment models are still unable to address systematic changes in productivity due to external factors such as inter-species relationships and low-frequency aspects of climate change. Relatively simple data-moderate models may provide tractable linkages to ecosystem models, and are relatively easy to modify to reflect ecosystem forces.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: No additional ecosystem or environmental data were   included in the 2015 China rockfish assessment.

\item[Recommendation 3: Exploration of trans-boundary assessments with Canada should be initiated, and would benefit all parties. This also requires development of data inputs including historical catch reconstructions. Due to their transparency, data-moderate assessments may play an especially useful role in promoting trans-boundary fishery science.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: Canada has not conducted a stock assessment for  China rockfish.

\item[Recommendation 4: The data-moderate assessments assume known catches, but there is considerable uncertainty in historical catch reconstructions, particularly for the recreational fishery. This uncertainty has not been measured, and tools for incorporating this uncertainty in assessments are not well developed. This is an issue for all assessments.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: See response to the first recommendation.

\item[Recommendation 5: There are fundamental differences between XDB-SRA and exSSS in how stock productivity is modeled. For exSSS, FMSY increases as the ratio of BMSY/B0 decreases in a deterministic way, while there is no prior relationship between FMSY and the ratio of BMSY/B0 for XDB-SRA. It is unclear which of these assumptions is most appropriate. This is a broader issue than for just data-moderate assessments, since it questions the appropriateness of two-parameter curves such as Beverton-Holt to model the stock recruit relationship. Research to improve understanding of the relationship between the inputs of the XDB-SRA and exSSS productivity parameters is encouraged.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: The 2015 China rockfish assessment assumes a   Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship, with a fixed value for steepness   in all three models. The STAT agrees with the recommendation, and considers this a priority for “off-year” research.

\item[Recommendation 6: Different priors (uniform of q / uniform on log-q) for the additional variance term were used in the two assessment models. It is unclear which performs best, and, since this term affects the weights given to each index in the model fitting, the form of the prior will influence model results, particularly when the indices are in conflict.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: Additional variance parameters were estimated for all indices in the China rockfish models, but no explicit prior was used in Stock Synthesis, apart from specifying parameter bounds.


\item[Recommendation 7: Compare the standardized (onboard observer) indices from the proposed method with indices constructed by applying the Stephens-MacCall approach to the data aggregated by trip.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response:  Time constraints have not allowed for this analysis and it is a priority research topic for the next off-cycle year.

\item[Recommendation 8: The GMT representative also recommended expanding the analysis of CPUE data to additional sectors of the recreational fishery, such as private and rental boats. CPUE indices from these sectors may be useful in future assessments of nearshore stocks.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: Time constraints did not allow a private-mode index for the California recreational dockside survey.  Oregon and Washington both provided data for the private/rental and party/charter recreational  fleets from dockside surveys. A private boat mode index was considered for Oregon, but rejected due to infrequent catches of China. The WA recreational index included boat mode (charter and private) as a categorical variable in the delta-GLM analysis. \hfill \\

\item[Recommendation 9: The GMT representative noted that for certain nearshore species there is potential utility in using post-2003 RecFIN dockside data as well as onboard sampling data since depth restrictions have not constrained access to the adult population.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: The 2015 China rockfish assessment utilizes data   through 2014 for the onboard observer programs in California and   Oregon.  The California post-2003 dockside data were not used because a large percentage of the trips north of Pt. Conception were also sampled by the onboard observer program.

\item[Recommendation 10: The Panel strongly emphasizes the value of conducting a data workshop during which catches, indices, biology, and other data inputs are reviewed.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: The China STAT team participated in the Nearshore Stock Assessment Workshop held March 31-April 2, 2015 in Portland, OR.

\item[Recommendation 11: The historical CPFV drift-specific data should be keypunched, which should allow the algorithm for developing CPFV-based data indices to be improved.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: The SWFSC Fisheries Ecology Division key-punched and error-checked the CDFW 1987-1998 onboard observer survey data.  These data were included in an onboard index.

\item[Recommendation 12: Recommendation: Habitat maps should be developed so that structural rather than true zeros are designated using data which are independent from the data used to determine the indices.] \hfill \\

2015 STAT response: Habitat maps and 'reefs' were defined by the SWFSC using the California Seafloor Mapping Project and the Oregon State waters Mapping Program mapping products.  These habitat maps were used to select data for the onboard observer indices in both California and Oregon.

\end{description}

##Response to the 2015 STAR Panel Requests
\begin{description}[style=unboxed]

\item[Request No. 1: Explore the utility of using California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) data from 2004-2007 to partition California catches in the early years based on the proportion of catch in the private recreational and charter modes north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude (concerns the southern and central models).] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} This may be a better alternative to the current approach of using logbook data to partition the recreational catches north 
      and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude.    

    \textbf{STAT Response:} This request was not completed, and was repeated as request no. 13.

\item[Request No. 2: Add the current assessment biomass trends for current base model to the plot in the draft assessment that compares the XDB-SRA and SS3 runs and plot an additional set of runs for all models where steepness and natural mortality are estimated with priors (add results from the northern and central models).  This would be two sets of plots with spawning biomass and depletion (all models).] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} To provide a comparison between the previous assessment results using XDB-SRA and the current assessment. 
    XDB-SRA has more flexible productivity assumptions than SS3, so estimating h and M was regarded as a way to more closely mimic 
    XDB-SRA using stock synthesis.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} The plots were provided (Figures \ref{fig:STARrequest2_CN} and \ref{fig:STARrequest2_S}).  Since XDB-SRA 
    had knife-edge maturity at age 5, summary biomass for ages 5 and older was used in the plot to provide a common basis for comparison. 
    For the southern model, the SS3 model with estimated h and M and XDB-SRA show similar results in absolute summary biomass and depletion.  
    For the north plus central models, it was not possible to simultaneously estimate h and M, but again the results were similar. 

\item[Request No. 3: Compare the amount of available habitat for China rockfish in the area covered by northern and central models with estimates of $R_0$ for the northern and central models.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} Available habitat by region may provide an independent proxy for the relative abundance of the stock in each region.
  
    \textbf{STAT Response:} Available rocky habitat was examined using two methods, and ratios of habitat between areas showed an increase in 
    habitat from the northern area, to the central area, and to southern area with the most habitat.  The Panel regarded this as a useful exercise 
    for ranking assessment areas, but it cannot be used for determining relative abundance.  There were a number of methodological issues that would 
    need to be addressed to do this more rigorously, and ultimately its application to stock assessment would be indirect given the assumptions 
    required. The Panel will consider making a research recommendation to examine the estimated area of reefs at more finely resolved scales.

\item[Request No. 4: Provide a model run where historical discards for the live-fish fishery are modeled as a separate fleet.  For the discard fleet, estimate actual tonnage of catch: apply the discard fraction for the earliest four years to estimate discards back to 2000 with a ramp from 1990 to 2000 (selectivity for this fleet is the determined from the discard length comps) (southern model only).] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} Fits to discard amount for the live-fish fishery by the model since 2000 are poor, and the model structure does not allow 
    flexibility to decrease the discards prior to 2000.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} This was done. Fits generally improved and the estimated selectivity pattern for the discard fleet appeared reasonable. 
    The STAR Panel and the STAT agreed that the base model should incorporate this new approach.

\item[Request No. 5: Provide the proportion of trips removed using the Stephens-MacCall filter over time as a diagnostic for all area models.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} To evaluate potential bias in the filtering procedure. 

    \textbf{STAT Response:} This was done for the northern area, and proportion of trips retained showed a temporal pattern of a slight increase followed by a decline in number of trips retained.  The STAT asked that this request be considered a low priority for the other areas because it was not clear what the patterns in proportion of trips retained would indicate, and the northern area model was not sensitive to index treatment.  The Panel agreed.  Further investigation is needed and this will be added to the list of research recommendations.  Examination of the characteristics of trips retained/removed using the Stephens-MacCall method should be a routine part of index standardization. 

\item[Request No. 6: For the central model, provide a run where the northern California size composition data are added to the model, estimate two selectivity parameters (i.e., the simpler selectivity function), and estimate M to understand how this affects fits to the length composition data.  Provide residual plots.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} This may produce a selectivity pattern that has a more realistic peak (full selection of a reasonable portion of observed lengths).

    \textbf{STAT Response:} The selectivity pattern improved but estimates a very high M (0.12) and produces an implausible estimate of biomass 
    (>1000 times the base model). The model is not supportable as a change to the base model.

\item[Request No. 7: Exclude the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistical Survey (MRFSS) index in Oregon to define a new base case for the central model.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:}  It was learned that multiple intercept interviews were done for a single trip, so the index was not constructed from 
    trip level data, as was intended. This only affects MRFSS index for Oregon.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} Excluding this index had a minor effect on model results.  This problem should be correctable so the STAR panel 
    will list this as a research recommendation.

\item[Request No. 8: Add in the northern California length composition data to central area model.  The selectivity pattern for this fishery should mirror the southern Oregon selectivity pattern.  Retune the length composition data.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} These data were inadvertently left out of the model.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} This was done.  Adding these data had a minor effect on model results. 

\item[Request No. 9: For the central area model, attempt to estimate the selectivity patterns for each fishery and determine which of the selectivity patterns provides plausible estimates.  Take the mean of those estimates (peak and/or spread parameters) and use the mean as a prior for the poorly estimated selectivities.  Consider using the mode of the observed length distribution as a prior for the peak parameter.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} To provide a more objective means to reflect selectivity parameters for those fleets where those parameters cannot be estimated.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} Alternative procedures resulted in models with small difference to the base case depletion, though scale is dependent 
    on the choice of peak value for selectivity for parameters that were required to be fixed (highest estimated value that didn’t hit the bound of 
    45 cm).  The Panel agreed that the original procedure used for the base case was simple and more supportable from a methodological viewpoint.

\item[Request No. 10: For the central area model, repeat Request  No. 9 using a two parameter ascending logistic curve for selectivity.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} To examine the effect on model results of using a different functional form for asymptotic selectivity.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} Logistic curves did not improve model results, and all the same issues remain.

\item[Request No. 11: Turn on estimation of recruitment deviations for all models, and iteratively increase $\sigma_R$ from a low value until the residual pattern stabilizes.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} To determine whether estimating recruitment deviations can be supported by any of the models.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} All models estimated extremely large recruitments in the 1980s and early 1990s that seem implausible and are not 
    obvious in size composition data. For the southern area model, the standard error of recruitment deviance is larger than $\sigma_R$  for 
    many early estimates, which is a nonsensical result. The likelihood components show slightly worse fit to indices, an improved fit for age 
    composition data, and the most improvement for size composition data. This suggests that the estimated recruitment deviations are being 
    driven by relatively subtle signals in the length composition data rather than improved ability to fit the trends in the indices.  The Panel
    concluded that there was insufficient information to estimate recruitment deviations for all models. Therefore no changes were made to the base 
    model. One potential area of research for data-moderate stocks would be evaluate the effect of assuming different levels autocorrelation in the 
    stock-recruit relationship.  This might help curb the tendency to estimate extreme recruitment with sparse datasets.

\item[Request No. 12: For all models, explore alternative methods of reweighting the conditional age-at-length data, but do not increase the weight on any data set.  Alternatives to evaluate are: the unmodified sample size (the method used for the base case), and Francis weighting method A and B (report the values of A and B).] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} Methods for weighting conditional age-at-length data are a current active area of research with no generally agreed procedures,
    so model sensitivity to each method requires examination.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} For the southern area model the weights for both the Francis A and B methods were above one, so no reweighting was 
    applied. For both the central and the northern area models, Francis method A for the most part strongly downweights the conditional age-at-length data.  
    The situation is most extreme for the northern area model, where iterative application of Frances method A appeared to be leading to a zero weight 
    being given to conditional age-at-length data. Weighting is highly influential on both absolute biomass and relative depletion.

    The Francis method A appears to produce unrealistically small weights for conditional age-at-length data in some cases. Apparently Francis method A 
    is the recommended approach in preference to method B (C. Francis, pers. comm.), but the Panel was unable to find clear rationale for this recommendation.
    The harmonic mean method has a history of use and theoretical basis in the multinomial distribution, and generally provides weightings that are intermediate 
    to no weighting (unmodified initial otolith counts) and the Frances method A. The Panel recommended that the harmonic mean should be used for now as it
    provides a compromise between no weighting and Francis A, while noting that a workshop with a focus on these methods later this year may result in the
    general recommendation of one of the existing methods or a new procedure.  

\item[Request No. 13: Explore the utility of using California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) data from 2004-2007 to partition California catches in the early years based on the proportion of catch in the private recreational and charter modes north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude (this concerns the southern and central models). This is a repeat of Request No. 1.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} This may be a better alternative to the current approach of using logbook data to partition the recreational catches north and 
    south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude.

\textbf{STAT Response:} This analysis was completed. South of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude, the difference in model results between using CRFS data and logbook for the apportioning catches is small. North of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude there is a greater difference, primarily a change in initial stock size.  The logbook method was based on data collected over a long period of time, while the CRFS method is based only on recent data.  The logbook method better captures temporal changes in fishery, while CRFS method provides better information on relative catches between private and charter boats.  In Oregon, recreational fishing for nearshore rockfish began around 1970, and this should be indicative of northern California.  The STAR panel and STAT agreed that the logbook method should be used because the reconstructed catches are more consistent with what is known about the gradual development of the recreational fishery in northern California. Nevertheless, the Panel flagged improved methods for reconstructing recreational catches as a research recommendation.

\item[Request No. 14: A set of revised base models should be brought forward with the following recommended changes:] \hfill \\
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Use weight specific fecundity relationships from Dick (2009) for all models.}
\item \textbf{Update 2011 and 2012 data in the onboard observer CPUE index (southern model).}
\item \textbf{Change the years in the Abrams dataset to 2010-2011; remove observations N of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude (southern model).}
\item \textbf{Model discards as a separate fleet (southern model).}
\item \textbf{Remove Oregon MRFSS index (central model).}
\item \textbf{Add northern California length composition data (central model).}
\item \textbf{Fix any selectivity parameters hitting upper bounds (central model).}
\end{itemize}

    \textbf{Rationale:} All of these changes have been identified and agreed to as changes that need to be made to the base models.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} The changes were implemented to establish a new set of base models for China rockfish.

\item[Request No. 15: Tune all models using the harmonic mean method for the conditional age-at-length composition and marginal age composition data. ] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} The Panel recommended that the harmonic mean method be used to re-weight the conditional age-at-length composition data, because it is a well-understood and frequently applied method that provided intermediate results compared to other alternatives.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} This was done and considered appropriate as a new base model.

\item[Request No. 16: Estimate M in the revised base models for southern and northern models, and use the average of those estimates as a fixed value for all models.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} The northern and southern area models (but not the central area model) provide some objective basis for the selection of an 
    appropriate value for M.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} Although the estimates of M for the northern and southern area models are reasonable, the estimate for the central area M 
    (0.116) is difficult to support. The age composition data are noisy, but fits suggest that more young fish are observed than would be expected for 
    lower values of M, outweighing the effect of older fish on the fits, which results in the preference towards a higher M in this model. There are a 
    good number of observations of older fish that arguably are more important in terms of stock status that should be fitted by the model, and only the 
    lower M values provide a reasonable fit to the oldest age observations. Values of M of 0.09 and above lead to unrealistically high biomass and minimal
    effect of fishing, results which appear to conflict with the habitat-based relative biomass among models. The median of the prior for M is 0.05 for this
    stock, and it is unclear why the data are so informative about the value of M.  The northern and southern area models have more age data than the central
    area model, and the abundance indices show contrast, which is not apparent in the central area indices. Consequently the northern and southern area models
    may provide more supportable values for M. The Panel’s proposed approach is to use the average of the estimated M values for the southern and northern area
    models (0.07) as a fixed value for all assessments.

\item[Request No. 17: Provide likelihood profiles for M in all revised base models; consider providing a combined likelihood profile in one graphic for all models.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} Since the estimated values for M may be used as fixed value in all assessments, the Panel would like the STAT to examine the likelihood 
    profiles as a useful diagnostic.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} Likelihood profiles for both the southern and northern area models appear quite reasonable, particularly the northern 
    area model where both the index data and the age data support the estimated M value. It should be noted that since these models are not estimating 
    recruitment deviations, they are highly constrained, and may provide misleadingly precise estimates compared to models with greater flexibility.

\item[Request No. 18: Normalize all indices and provide time series plots in which groups of comparable indices are plotted together (southern and central models).  Provide time series plots in which groups of comparable index residuals are plotted together.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} To assess the comparability of indices prior to incorporation in the assessment model.
 
    \textbf{STAT Response:} This was done, see Figures \ref{fig:STARrequest18_S} and \ref{fig:STARrequest18_C}. In the southern area model, overall 
    trends are broadly consistent with the model biomass and show a decline to the late 1990s, followed by an increase. The model has the ability to 
    scale the periods before and after 2000 due a lack of overlap of indices in this period.  The observer CPFV index shows a sustained decline after 
    2005 that the model is unable to match, even when recruitment deviations are turned on.  Because China rockfish is a very long-lived species, 
    age-structured population dynamics precludes rapid changes in abundance when fishing is relatively stable, suggesting that there must be some 
    other cause for this recent trend. Indices for the central area show similar pattern from 2000 to 2014 across three indices that are also difficult
    to account for with China rockfish population dynamics. The Panel discussed potential interactions with other species (e.g., black rockfish) due 
    to hook competition, and regulatory changes as factors that could affect CPUE indices derived from a multi-species recreational fishery.  Panel will 
    add a research recommendation that these factors be investigated. 

\item[Request No. 19: Provide likelihood profiles on M for all base models, which now are using a fixed value of M of 0.07.  Plot predicted spawning output on the M profile plots.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} To evaluate whether the profiles for M for the base models for the northern and southern area are well determined as a 
    justification using a single fixed value across all models, and to also demonstrate the inadequacy of the central model for estimating M

    \textbf{STAT Response:} This was done. The new base models behaved as expected (except for spawning output declining at very high M for southern 
    area model). 

\item[Request No. 20: Provide bracketing model runs varying M (high and low Ms should be equidistant from the base M (high M =0.09; base M = 0.07; low M = 0.05 (set to the median of the prior)) for potential decision tables.  Assume projected ACL removals for a category 2 stock (P* = 0.45, σ = 0.72, 40-10 adj. as needed) applied to high and low M scenarios. Also provide projected ACL removals under base case, and recent year catches (if different than base case ACLs).] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} Development of a potential axis of uncertainty based on M.
 
    \textbf{STAT Response:} This was done.

\item[Request No. 21: Update the figures from Request No. 2 with the new base models (show summary biomass).] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} To provide a comparison between the previous assessment results using XDB-SRA and the current assessment.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} This was done (Figure \ref{fig:STARrequest21}). The current base models deviate more strongly from 
    the results using XDB-SRA than the pre-STAR models, but results remain broadly consistent (i.e., biomass estimates differ by no more than a factor of two). 

\item[Request No. 22: Provide runs of for the central model treating all age compositions as marginal (fix growth parameters, and alternatively fix and estimate M).] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} This may provide improved fits to composition data, and may also provide further evidence that large values for M 
    above 0.1 for the central model are implausible.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} Results were only very slightly different to the base model, so no additional information was provided for the assessment.

\item[Request No. 23: Provide two runs from the base for the southern area model that bracket uncertainty in steepness. Use values of 0.6 and 0.9 which are close to the 12.5 and 87.5 percentiles from the Thorson prior. Provide projected biomass to compare with current bracketing models with M.] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} To determine whether uncertainty in M sufficiently captures uncertainty for decision tables for the southern area model.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} This was done. The bracketing model runs for steepness and M produced remarkably similar results, allowing the Panel 
    to agree to use only M to bracket uncertainty for management advice for the southern area model, and to do the same for the northern and central 
    area models.

\item[Request No. 24: The STAR panel requested a detailed justification be provided for the decisions regarding stock structure assumed in the assessment(s) (i.e., growth differences, size composition, fishery discard rates, evidence of low larval drift, and management history and jurisdiction).] \hfill \\

    \textbf{Rationale:} This information was not provided in detail in the draft assessment document. This is just a bookkeeping request as the
    Panel had discussed with the STAT the importance of providing supporting information on stock structure decisions, but no formal request was 
    forwarded to the STAT.

    \textbf{STAT Response:} This information will be included in the final assessment document.

##Model Description

###Transition from the 2013 to 2015 stock assessment
The first formal assessment of China rockfish was conducted as a data moderate assessment in 2013 [@Cope2015].  The results of the 2013 assessment were based on catch histories and indices of abundance from onboard (OR and CA) and dockside (OR and CA) surveys of the recreational fishing fleet.  Below, we describe the most important changes made since the last full assessment and explain rationale for each change.  [Note: descriptions below apply to the pre-STAR base model, and were not modified to reflect the final base model in order to provide a record of events leading to selection of the final model]:

1. Population dynamics model changed from a Bayesian surplus production model (XDB-SRA) with two areas (U.S. waters north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude) to a length-based, age-structured statistical catch at age model (Stock Synthesis) with three areas (U.S. waters south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude to the OR-WA border, and from the OR-WA border to the U.S.-Canadian border). \emph{Rationale}: The assessment is moving from a data moderate to a full assessment, incorporating new data sources, e.g., individual growth, age and length compositions of landed and discarded catch.

2. New point estimate for annual natural mortality rate (0.053).  \emph{Rationale}: median of a prior distribution derived from a method endorsed by the SSC (O. Hamel, NWFSC; pers. comm.).

3. Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship with steepness fixed at 0.773.  \emph{Rationale}:  when estimated, steepness in the model approaches implausible values (near 1). Although uncertainty in model results is greatly underestimated, steepness in each submodel was fixed at the mean of a prior distribution derived from a meta-analysis of rockfish steepness parameters (J. Thorson, NWFSC; pers. comm.).

4. Revised catch histories for California, Oregon, and Washington. \emph{Rationale}: agency representatives for each state either prepared (OR and WA) or reviewed (CA) revised catch histories for the commercial and recreational fisheries.

5. Updated indices of abundance through 2014. \emph{Rationale}: following research recommendations from the last assessment, current indices include revised recreational CPUE based on spatially-referenced, onboard observer data combined with habitat data, as well as catch and effort data by fishing-stop from the 1988-1999 CDFW onboard observer program.

6. Two new recreational dockside CPUE indices for northern Washington (1981-2014) and Oregon (2004-2014). \emph{Rationale}: previous assessment had no trend information for Washington state, and did not include CPUE from the high-intensity dockside sampling program in Oregon (ORBS).

7. New commercial logbook CPUE index for the southern Oregon nearshore fishery (2004-2013). \emph{Rationale}: previous assessment contained no indices of abundance based on commercial fisheries data. This (primarily live-fish) nearshore fishery has expanded rapidly over the past two decades.

8. Models include new age data representing all three states. \emph{Rationale}: allows growth to be estimated in each sub-model based on conditional-age-at-length composition data.

9. Discards modeled explicitly with selectivity and retention curves in the southern area model. \emph{Rationale}: new length composition data for discarded catch permits explicit modeling of retention and selectivity in the southern commercial live-fish fishery.

Prior to the STAR Panel review meeting, age-structured production models (i.e., fit only to indices of abundance) were developed in Stock Synthesis to mimic the XDB-SRA models from the 2013 stock assessment. Trends in stock status and overall scale were similar among models for the northern substock (Figures \ref{fig:transition_spawnB_N} and \ref{fig:transition_depletion_N}), but the southern substock was estimated to have a larger unfished biomass and similar current biomass (i.e. a more depleted stock) when the data were fit in Stock Synthesis (Figures \ref{fig:transition_spawnB_S} and \ref{fig:transition_depletion_S}). The age-structured model makes different assumptions from the last assessment about production (Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship, with steepness estimated at 0.88 and 0.89 in the northern and southern models, respectively) and growth, which may explain the differences between the two population dynamics models.  See Request #2 from the 2015 STAR Panel for a comparison of final base model results to the 2013 assessment.

###Definition of fleets and areas
We generated data sources for each of the models.  Fleets include:

**Northern Model**     
\emph{Recreational}: All catch in the northern model is recreational. The recreational fleets include separate landings from the party/charter and private/rental modes in MCAs 3-4 and combined party/charter and private/rental modes for MCAs 1-2 (where catches and sample sizes were lower).

**Central Model**       
\emph{Commercial}:  The commercial fleets include five separate fleets, one each for the live and dead commercial fishers in the following areas, California north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, southern Oregon. Live and dead commercial fisheries were combined for northern Oregon as commercial landings were low in this area.

\emph{Recreational}:  The recreational fleets include six separate fleets, one each for the party/charter and private/rental modes in the following areas, California north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, southern Oregon, and northern Oregon.

**Southern Model**      
\emph{Commercial}: The commercial fleets include separate catches for the live and dead fish fisheries, as well as discards from the live-fish fishery.    

\emph{Recreational}: The recreational fleets include landings from the party/charter and private/rental modes.  There are three indices of abundance: CDFW 1989-1999 CPFV onboard observer, CDFW 2000-2014 CPFV onboard observer, MRFSS 1980-2003 CPFV dockside. 

\emph{Research}: Length compositions from Jeff Abrams thesis [@Abrams2014] and the CCFRP study.





###Summary of data for fleets and areas

###Modeling software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.24u by Dr. Richard Methot at the NWFSC. This most recent version (SS-V3.24u) was used, since it included improvements and corrections to older versions.

###Data weighting
Length composition sample sizes for all models were tuned by the "Francis method" (also known as "TA1.8")  [@Francis2011], as implemented in the r4ss package. This approach involves comparing the residuals in the model’s expected mean length with respect to the observed mean length and associated uncertainty derived from the composition vectors and their associated input sample sizes. The sample sizes are then tuned so that the observed and expected variability are consistent. After adjustment to the sample sizes, models were not re-tuned as long as the bootstrap uncertainty value around the tuning factor overlapped 1.0.

Age compositions and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997]. Two variations on the Francis method were also considered for the CAAL data, dependent on whether or not the vectors of age at length are considered independent within each year. Data weighting in general, and the Francis method are topics of ongoing research and there is no clear guidance on a preferred method. In the southern model, both approaches indicated that the fit was already better than expected with the input sample sizes left in place. For the central and northern models, Francis method A suggested that the CAAL sample sizes should be greatly reduced to achieve reasonable fit (effectively down weighting the CAAL data out of the northern model) while Francis method B suggested little tuning was needed. 


###Priors
In the pre-STAR panel base models, the mean of the priors for Beverton-Holt steepness parameter (Dorn, M. and Thorson, J., pers. comm.) and natural mortality [@Hamel2015] were used as fixed values across the three models. The priors were applied in sensitivity analyses where these parameters were estimated.

The final base models also used the mean of the Beverton-Holt steepness prior, but fixed natural mortality at the mean of the estimated values from the northern and southern regions.


###General model specifications
Stock synthesis has a broad suite of structural options available. Where possible, the ‘default’ or most commonly used approaches are applied to this stock assessment. The assessment is sex-aggregated, including the estimation of growth curves and selectivity.
 
This stock assessment is divided into three independent areas, the south (California south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude), the central (north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude to the Oregon-Washington border), and the north (Washington state) based on latitudinal patterns in the length composition data and fits to size at age data. The time-series of landings begins during 1900, and captures the inception of the fishery, so the stock is assumed to be in equilibrium at the beginning of the modeled period.
 
The internal population dynamics model tracks ages 0-80, where age 80 is the ‘plus-group.’ As there is little growth occurring at age 80, the data use a plus group of age 50; there are relatively few observations in the age compositions that are greater than age 50.

All models used the posterior predictive fecundity relationship from Dick [-@Dick2009].
 
The following likelihood components are included: catch, indices, discards (south only), discarded catch (south only), length compositions, age compositions, parameter priors, and parameter soft bounds. See the SS technical documentation for details [@Methot2013].
 
Model data, control, starter, and forecast files can be found in Appendices A-D.


###Estimated and fixed parameters
A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables \ref{tab:N_model_params}, \ref{tab:C_model_params}, and \ref{tab:S_model_params}. Time-invariant, sex-aggregated growth is estimated for all modeled areas in this assessment. Recruitment deviations are not estimated due to a lack of visible cohorts in either the length or age data. In the pre-STAR models natural mortality was fixed at 0.053, the median of the Hamel prior [@Hamel2015], and the stock-recruitment steepness is fixed at the SSC approved steepness prior of 0.773.  However, post-STAR models fix M at 0.07 for all models, the average of the estimated M’s from the northern and southern models (the central area model was unable to estimate M). Asymptotic selectivity is generally used in the base case models.


##Model Selection and Evaluation

###Key assumptions and structural choices
All structural choices for stock assessment models are likely to be important under some circumstances. In this assessment these choices are generally made to 1) be as objective as possible and 2) follow generally accepted methods of approaching similar models and data. The relative effect on assessment results of each of these choices is often unknown; however an effort is made to explore alternate choices through sensitivity analysis. Major choices in the structuring of this stock assessment model include the independent north, central and south area models that use disaggregated fleet structuring and mirrored selectivity for fleets with little or no length and age composition data. All of these models fix the values for natural mortality and stock-recruitment steepness as there is not enough information in the data to reliably estimate these important productivity parameters.  Recruitment is assumed to be deterministic in all models, as the data do not contain sufficient information to resolve the strength of individual year classes.

###Alternate models explored
Sensitivity analyses included a comparison of key model assumptions were based on nested models and included asymptotic vs. domed selectivity, alternative values of M, and alternative fleet mirroring structure for estimating selectivity. For the area North of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, an alternative model in which both Central and North areas were included in a single, spatially-explicit model. However, differences in growth found between Oregon and Washington supported independent models.

###Convergence
Convergence testing through use of dispersed starting values often requires extreme values to actually explore new areas of the multivariate likelihood surface. Jitter is a SS option that generates random starting values from a normal distribution logistically transformed into each parameter's range [@Methot2015]. Table \ref{tab:jitter} shows the results of running 100 jitters for each pre-STAR base model. The northern model, which has the least amount of data and the fewest number of estimating parameters (8), returned to the same base case solution every time. The central model, with 14 parameters had 6% of the starting values cause errors in the likelihood but the remaining runs returned to the base model. The southern model, which had the most estimated parameters (16), had some jitters converge to a local minimum with worse likelihood, but the majority returned to the base model.


##Base-Model(s) Results
Base models for all three areas (northern, central, and southern) are combined sex models, based on lack of evidence for sexually dimorphic growth in the available size-at-age data as well as in previous studies. Key productivity parameters are fixed at measures of central tendency from prior distributions endorsed by the PFMC's SSC due to the models' inabilities to estimate reasonable parameter values. Specifically, steepness of the assumed Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship was fixed at 0.773.  In the final base models the instantaneous rate of annual natural mortality was fixed at $0.07 yr^{-1}$, the average between the estimated natural mortality from the northern and southern models. Estimated parameters in each model vary, and are described in the area-specific results sections, below.

**Northern**

The northern base-case model produces reasonable estimates of growth parameters, with China rockfish in northern Washington reaching a maximum length of 35.4 cm  (Table \ref{tab:N_model_params}, Figure \ref{fig:growth_all}). The northern base-case model was able to fit the northern Washington recreational index of abundance with an estimated additional standard deviation of 0.13 (Table \ref{tab:N_model_params}). However, there are runs of years in which the model consistently either over or under fits the data (Figure \ref{fig:N_index2_cpuefit_3_WA_NorthernWA_Rec_PR}). The model fit to the index estimates a declining trend in the fit between the 1980s and 1990s, followed by a flat trend through recent years.
 
Fits to the time aggregated southern Washington recreational length distributions are poor, where data are sparse, with the model expecting more fish sized approximately 27 cm to 34 cm and fewer fish greater than 40 cm than are present in the data (Figure \ref{fig:N_comp_lenfit_mkt2_aggregated_across_time}). However, fits to the time aggregated northern Washington recreational length distributions, the area with most of the data and landings, are good 
(Figures \ref{fig:N_comp_lenfit_mkt2_aggregated_across_time} and \ref{fig:N_comp_lenfit_sex1mkt2_multi-fleet_comparison}). The model fits the recreational conditional age-at-length data reasonably (Figures \ref{fig:N_comp_condAALfit_residsflt3mkt2} and \ref{fig:N_comp_gstagefit_flt3mkt2}).  There are a few outliers, including two 15-year-old fish in the 22 cm bin in 2005 and one 14-year-old fish in the 20 cm bin in 2010 but there are no strong patterns in the residuals.
 
Estimated selectivity curves for the Washington recreational southern and northern fleets suggest different ascending width parameters, resulting in the southern fleet selecting smaller China rockfish than the northern fleet (Figure \ref{fig:N_sel01_multiple_fleets_length1}). The southern fleet asymptote was unable to be estimated so it was fixed to the estimate from the northern fleet.


**Central**

The central base-case model produces reasonable estimates of growth parameters, with China rockfish in the central area reaching a length of 37.44 cm at age 30 (Table \ref{tab:C_model_params}, Figure \ref{fig:growth_all}). The central base-case model fits to the indices of abundance are generally flat to slightly declining, with many model fits showing runs of years in which the model consistently either over or under fits the data (Figures \ref{fig:C_index2_cpuefit_6_OR_SouthernOR_Comm_Live}, \ref{fig:C_index2_cpuefit_10_OR_NorthernOR_Rec_PC}, \ref{fig:C_index2_cpuefit_12_OR_SouthernOR_Rec_PC_ORBS}). Each of the central model indices of abundance except the Oregon southern commercial live fish fishery were fit estimating additional standard deviations of 0.15, 0.50, and 0.08 for the Oregon commercial logbook index, the Oregon onboard recreational index, and the Oregon ORBS index, respectively (Table \ref{tab:C_model_params}). 

Fits to the central model length distributions are reasonable given the small samples sizes, particularly during the early years, and the constraints applied to selectivity parameters (Figures \ref{fig:C_comp_lenfit_sex1mkt2_page1_multi-fleet_comparison}, and \ref{fig:C_comp_lenfit_sex1mkt2_page2_multi-fleet_comparison}). The model fits the Oregon southern commercial fishery best, shifts the peak of the fitted distribution to the left for the Oregon southern recreational private/rental, Oregon southern recreational party/charter, and Oregon northern recreational private/rental fleets, and under fits the peak of the time aggregated length distributions for the Oregon southern commercial live fish and Oregon northern recreational party/charter fleets. The model fits the conditional age-at-length data from the southern Oregon commercial dead-fish fishery poorly with clusters in the residuals and fewer observations in the age-50+ bin than expected by the model (Figure \ref{fig:C_comp_condAALfit_residsflt5mkt2}). The residual patterns are less notable in the fit to conditional age-at-length data from the southern Oregon recreational party/charter (Figure \ref{fig:C_comp_condAALfit_residsflt7mkt2}). For both these datasets, the largest residuals are associated with young fish at large sizes, including commercial catch of fish aged 10 years and younger in the 35-40cm range in 2002 through 2004 and a recreational observation in 2011 in the 44 cm length bin estimated at 10 years old.  In many years the model expects more fish in the plus group (age 50) than are actually present in the data, but years where 50+ age fish were observed, this observations is typically larger than the expectation. The fit to the marginal age compositions from the northern Oregon recreational fishery are reasonable given the low sample sizes of this fleet (which is the reason it was not represented as conditioned on length) although generally more fish in the 5-10 year old range were observed than expected by the model (Figure \ref{fig:C_ comp_agefit_flt10mkt2}).

The central model does not explicitly model discards due to low discard rates and the limited availability of discard data. However, a discard fraction of 2.69% of the annual commercial landings has been added to the commercial landings to account for the total removals by the commercial fisheries. 

Asymptotic selectivity curves are estimated for all fleets with length compositions (Figure \ref{fig:C_sel01_multiple_fleets_length1}). The exceptions included the northern Oregon commercial fishery which shared the selectivity curve for the southern Oregon life-fish commercial fishery, and the northern Oregon private/rental fleet that was assumed to share the selectivity with the party/charter fleet in this same area. Many of the recreational has estimates of peak selectivity that hit the upper bound of 45 cm, well above the estimated asymptotic size. These parameters were all reduced to (fixed at) the highest peak selectivity parameter among the recreational fleets that was not hitting a bound: 39.9 cm. The ascending width parameters showed small differences among all fleets (Table \ref{tab:C_model_params}). The commercial selectivity parameters generally had peak values estimated at a lower point than the recreational selectivities.

**Southern**

The model for the area south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude produces reasonable values of estimated growth parameters in the base-case model, with China rockfish in the southern management area reaching an asymptotic length (converted from Schnute parameterization) of 31.5 cm, with von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, k = 0.144, and a coefficient of variation of 12% for length at age 30 (Figure \ref{fig:growth_all}). The southern base-case model best fit the southern area recreational dockside index of abundance with an estimated additional standard deviation of 0.12, and the two recreational onboard indices (1988-1999 and 2000-2014) with additional SDs of 0.15 and 0.18, respectively (Table \ref{tab:S_model_params}). However, in all three indices there are runs of positive or negative residuals. The model is able to capture a decline in catch rates from the 1980s to the late 1990s / early 2000s in the dockside recreational CPUE index (Figure \ref{fig:S_index2_cpuefit_3_CA_SouthOf4010_Rec_PC}), but slightly underestimates a declining trend in the 1988-1999 onboard observer index (Figure \ref{fig:S_index2_cpuefit_6_CA_SouthOf4010_Rec_PC_DWV_index}). The model is consistent with an observed increasing trend from 2000-2012 in the more recent onboard observer index, but was not able to capture a recent drop in catch rates in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:S_index2_cpuefit_7_CA_SouthOf4010_Rec_PC_onboard_index}).

Fits to the time-aggregated southern recreational private and charter boat length distributions, the fleets with most of the data and landings, are most consistent with the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:S_comp_lenfit_mkt2_aggregated_across_time}). Length data from the commercial fisheries (live-fish fishery and fish landed dead) are fit reasonably well by the model (Figure \ref{fig:S_comp_lenfit_mkt2_aggregated_across_time}).

Fits to the length compositions from the central California onboard observer and CCFRP surveys (fleets observing whole, retained plus discarded, catch) are good for the onboard observer data (which mirrors the selectivity of the recreational charter boat fishery), but the model a larger variance and smaller mode in time-aggregated lengths relative to the data from the CCFRP survey (Figure \ref{fig:S_comp_lenfit_mkt0_aggregated_across_time}).

The model fits the conditional age-at-length data from Jeff Abrams' thesis [@Abrams2014] reasonably well (Figure \ref{fig:S_comp_condAALfit_Andre_plotsflt9mkt0}), particularly for years with larger sample sizes.

Length-based selectivity parameters estimated in the southern base model include, for each fleet, the size at 100% vulnerability ('peak' parameter), and the 'width' of the ascending limb of the selectivity curve (a cumulative normal distribution, Figure \ref{fig:S_sel01_multiple_fleets_length1}). Peak values ranged from 27.6 cm (commercial discards) to 35.5 cm (commercial live-fish fishery).  The recreational catches represent both retained and discarded fish, the composition data in the base model represents only retained fish. Recreational length composition data for discarded fish are available from the onboard charter boat observer programs, and could potentially be used to model retention and selectivity separately. The STAT was not able to attempt this analysis for the southern model due to time constraints (see research recommendations).

Discards in the pre-STAR base model were estimated in the southern area model for the commercial live-fish fishery. This model did not fit the length composition data for the commercial live-fish fishery well, and did not capture the increasing trend in the proportion of discarded catch south of Cape Mendocino. During the STAR panel, the STAT adopted a recommendation made by the panel to treat discarded commercial catch as a separate “fleet” in Stock Synthesis, which greatly improved the fits to the discard length composition data and greatly improved the fits to the length composition of retained catch in the commercial live-fish fishery.



##Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
\label{sec:uncertainty}
The base-case assessment model includes parameter uncertainty from a variety of sources, but underestimates the considerable uncertainty in recent trend and current stock status. For this reason, in addition to asymptotic confidence intervals (based upon the model’s analytical estimate of the variance near the converged solution), two alternate states of nature (low and high values of M) are presented in a decision table. Much additional exploration of uncertainty was performed prior the STAR panel. Some of that exploration of other sources of uncertainty is provided below. Specifically, for each pre-STAR area model, the following sensitivity runs were performed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item “Drop-one” analyses: remove single data types from the model -- indices, discards, length compositions (down-weighted by scaling Francis weights by factor of 0.25), and age compositions.

\item Alternative data-weighting criterion. The base model length compositions are tuned based on the Francis method (Francis2011), as implemented in the r4ss package. An alternative method based on the harmonic mean effective sample size (McAllister and Ianelli 1997).

\item Free up size at age 0 (1 run) and CV at A\_min (1 run)

\item Fix growth at external estimate (1 run)
\end{enumerate}

**Northern Model**

Tabular results for the northern area pre-STAR model sensitivity runs can be viewed here: \ref{tab:N_sensitivity},
and associated ﬁgures are here: Figures \ref{fig:N_compare1_spawnbio} and \ref{fig:N_compare3_Bratio}. The model 
for the northern manage-
ment area was not sensitive to dropping the index of abundance, data weighting methods,
downweighting length comps (75% reduction in Francis weights, i.e. weights multiplied by
0.25). The pre-STAR models that attempted to estimate the size at age 0 and CV at Age minimum
growth parameters resulted parameters going to bounds, producing unrealistic estimates for
these parameter values. The pre-STAR model was highly sensitive to the exclusion of age the com-
position data and ﬁxing growth the externally estimated values. Lack of age data and
ﬁxing growth to the external estimates produced an approximate doubling in the estimates
of the stock size and in the status of the population. Removal of the age composition data,
modeled as conditional age-at-length, impacts the scale of the pre-STAR model, in part because the
pre-STAR model is no longer able to estimate reasonable values of growth parameters. Fixing growth
to the externally estimated values is problematic because the data lack small/young ﬁsh,
resulting in high sensitivity to the k estimate.

When estimated with their respective prior distributions, both steepness and natural mor-
tality are larger than the ﬁxed values in the pre-STAR base model (h = 0.95, and M = 0.07). However,
the higher estimate of M contradicts the observed maximum age of 83 and the higher h
estimate is inconsistent with the current understanding of rockﬁsh productivity.

Additional sensitivities conducted during the STAR panel are described in the section “Response  to the 2015 STAR Panel Requests.”

**Central Model** 

Tabular results for the central area pre-STAR model sensitivity runs can be viewed here: Table \ref{tab:C_sensitivity}, and associated figures are here: Figures \ref{fig:C_compare1_spawnbio} and \ref{fig:C_compare3_Bratio}. The pre-STAR model for the central management area was not sensitive to dropping the index of abundance, data weighting methods, downweighting length comps (75% reduction in Francis weights, i.e. weights multiplied by 0.25). The pre-STAR models that attempted to estimate the size at age 0 and CV at Age minimum growth parameters resulted parameters going to bounds, producing unrealistic estimates for these parameter values. The pre-STAR model was highly sensitive to the exclusion of age the composition data and fixing growth the externally estimated values. Lack of age data resulted in an inability to estimate $R_0$, leading to unrealistic model results. Fixing growth to the external estimates produced an approximate doubling in the estimates of the stock size and in the status of the population. Fixing growth to the externally estimated values is problematic because the data lack small/young fish, resulting in high sensitivity to the k estimate. 

The central pre-STAR base model is unable to estimate M but when h is estimated it goes to a value of 0.75, very close to the fixed value from the pre-STAR base model of 0.773, indicating that the data do not contain much information about stock productivity. 

Additional sensitivities conducted during the STAR panel are described in the section “Response  to the 2015 STAR Panel Requests.”

**Southern Model**

The pre-STAR base model for the southern management area was not very sensitive to dropping indices or discard data, or to downweighting length comps (75% reduction in Francis weights, i.e. weights multiplied by 0.25). However, exclusion of age composition data significantly altered estimates of the scale and status of the population (Table \ref{tab:S_sensitivity}; Figures \ref{fig:S_drop1_compare1_spawnbio} and \ref{fig:S_drop1_compare3_Bratio}). Removal of marginal age composition data and conditional age-at-length data had a dramatic effect on model results, in part because the model is no longer able to estimate credible values of growth parameters (e.g. von Bertalanffy k = 0.027; Figure \ref{fig:S_drop1_growth_comparison}).

Weighting of data types (e.g. composition data vs. indices) in the pre-STAR base models was based on the method of Francis [-@Francis2011], as implemented in the r4ss package. An alternative method based on the harmonic mean effective sample size [@McAllister1997] was applied, and results were consistent with the Francis method (Figures \ref{fig:S_data_weights_compare1_spawnbio} and \ref{fig:S_data_weights_compare3_Bratio}).

The pre-STAR base model fixes length at age zero at 2 cm, with a CV of 0.1. Separate attempts to estimate these parameters in the model failed, with both going to unrealistic boundaries, i.e. size at age 0 years of 10 cm, and a CV of 0.01 (results not shown). If growth is estimated external to the model and fixed at those estimates, fits to the model degrade (increased negative log likelihoods) and the stock is more depleted, with biomass is 2015 at 23% of unfished biomass, below the minimum stock size threshold (Figures \ref{fig:S_ext_growth_comparison}, \ref{fig:S_growth_compare1_spawnbio}, and \ref{fig:S_growth_compare3_Bratio}).

The southern pre-STAR base model fixed parameters that determine stock productivity (steepness and natural mortality) at point estimates derived from prior distributions (see prior distributions section for details). When estimated with their respective prior distributions, both steepness and natural mortality are larger than the fixed values in the base model (h = 0.92, and M = 0.1). As noted in the profile likelihood analyses, the length and age composition data appear to support higher M values, but this contradicts the observed maximum age of 83. The data appear to have little information about steepness, and the estimated value is near the mode of the prior distribution (Figure \ref{fig:S_est_h_and_M_priors_and_MLEs}). Higher values of steepness and natural mortality result in a smaller, less-depleted stock (Figures \ref{fig:S_est_h_and_M_compare1_spawnbio} and \ref{fig:S_est_h_and_M_compare3_Bratio}). The estimated growth curve also changes, with a lower value of k and higher asymptotic size (Figure \ref{fig:S_est_h_and_M_growth_comparison}).

Additional sensitivities conducted during the STAR panel are described in the section “Response  to the 2015 STAR Panel Requests.”


\label{sec:uncertaintylast}

###Retrospective analysis
Retrospective analyses were conducted for each pre-STAR base model by conducting model runs that sequentially remove the last year of data over the last 5 base model years. The southern model showed very little change in estimated spawning biomass trajectory as a result of this data removal (Figure \ref{fig:S_retroS_compare1_spawnbio}). The central and northern models, however, showed that the each additional year of data added to the model has resulted in a higher initial spawning biomass (Figures \ref{fig:C_retroC_compare1_spawnbio} and \ref{fig:N_retroN_compare1_spawnbio}). These results are consistent with the dependence of the central and northern models on more recently collected data as compared to the southern model where the catch history began earlier.



###Likelihood profiles
**Pre-STAR base model likelihood profiles**

Likelihood profiles for equilibrium recruitment ($R_0$), natural mortality ($M$), and steepness ($h$), were completed to investigate the uncertainty in these parameters and their influence on the fit to different data sources. For all models, the age data had the largest influence on the scale of the population as indicated by the data type most influenced by $R_0$ (Figures \ref{fig:N_profile_logR0.N}, \ref{fig:C_profile_logR0.C}, and \ref{fig:S_profile_logR0.S}). In the southern model, the length and index data also had the best fit at a similar scale, showing consistency in these data sources about the population size. In the central model, lower $R_0$ values caused the model to fit the length data less well but higher values had little influence. The index data was most influential on the $R_0$ estimates in the northern model, where they were best fit with a higher equilibrium recruitment.

Profiles over natural mortality showed length and age data best fit by high $M$ values (greater than 0.10) in the central and south models (Figures \ref{fig:C_profile_Mortality.C} and \ref{fig:S_profile_Mortality.S}), while the value among those in the profile with best likelihood in the northern model was $M=0.08$ (Figure \ref{fig:N_profile_Mortality.N}). As in the profile over $R_0$, the index data in the northern model showed a larger influence on $M$ than the index data in the central and southern models.

Likelihood profiles were conducted over four values for the steepness of the stock-recruit curve ($h$ = 0.3, 0.6, 0.773, and 0.9), where 0.773 is the mean of the prior distribution and chosen as a fixed value in the three base models. These profiles indicated that for the southern and northern models (Figures \ref{fig:S_profile_Steepness} and \ref{fig:N_profile_Steepness}), length and age data were best fit by high steepness values, with the index in the northern model also showing a better fit at higher steepness. The central model, however, showed the best combined fit to all data sources at an intermediate value of steepness, with an MLE estimate when the parameter was estimated of $h = 0.753$, which is close to the prior mean (Figure \ref{fig:C_profile_Steepness}). This estimate represents a balance between the age data and steepness prior, which were best fit at higher steepness values, and the length data, which was best fit at lower steepness values. The index data in the central model showed less change in likelihood as a result of the steepness profile than the other data types, but it was the only type that was best fit at an intermediate value, $h = 0.6$.

**Final base model likelihood profiles**
 
Likelihood profiles over natural mortality were conducted for all of the final base models, and sensitivities to those models (Figures \ref{fig:N_profile_postSTAR}, \ref{fig:C_profile_postSTAR}, and \ref{fig:S_profile_postSTAR}).  The northern model had the best combined fit at the estimated value of natural mortality.  The southern model showed a good fit to the estimated value of natural mortality for the index data and the priors.  The length data in the southern model indicated a better fit at a lower value of natural mortality whereas the age data indicated the best fit towards the upper bound of the profile, M=0.12.  The central model was not able to estimate a reasonable value for natural mortality, with all data sources indicating the best fit to the data towards the upper bound of natural mortality in the profile.

#Reference Points

**Northern Model**

This stock assessment estimates that China rockfish in the north are well above the biomass target. The spawning biomass of the stock declined between the 1960s and 1990s but has largely been stable during the past few decades (Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_N}; Figure \ref{fig:N_ts7_Spawning_output_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). The estimated relative depletion level in 2015 is 73.4% (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 63.6% - 83.2%), corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 17.9 billion eggs (~95% asymptotic interval: 8.8 – 27.1 billion eggs) of spawning output in the base model (Table  \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_N}; Figure \ref{fig:N_ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). Unfished spawning output was estimated to be 24.4 billion eggs in the base case model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target ($SB_{40\%}$) is 9.8 billion eggs, which gives a catch of 6.2 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is 5.8 mt. Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_N} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the northern area model and Figure \ref{fig:N_yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium yield curve.



**Central Model** 

This stock assessment estimates that central area China rockfish are just above the biomass target (Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_C};  Figure \ref{fig:C_ts7_Spawning_output_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). The rate of spawning output decline is estimated to be steepest during the 1980s to 1990s and has continued to decline since the 1990s at a slower rate (Figure \ref{fig:C_ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). The estimated relative depletion level in 2015 is 61.5% (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 53.8% - 69.2%), corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 65.1 billion eggs (~95% asymptotic interval: 51.8 – 78.4 billion eggs) of spawning output in the base model (Table  \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_C}). Unfished age 5+ biomass was estimated to be 591.5 mt in the base case model. The target spawning output  based on the biomass target ($SB_{40\%}$) is 26 billion eggs, which gives a catch of 15.7 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is 14.5 mt. Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_C} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the central area model and Figure \ref{fig:C_yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium yield curve.

**Southern Model**

This stock assessment estimates that China rockfish south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude are below the biomass target, but above the minimum stock size threshold, and have been increasing over the last 15 years (Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_S}; Figure \ref{fig:S_ts7_Spawning_output_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). The estimated relative depletion level in 2015 is 27.9% (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 21.2% - 34.7%), corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 66.5 billion eggs (~95% asymptotic interval: 49.6 - 83.4 billion eggs) of spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_S}). Unfished age 5+ biomass was estimated to be  768.6 mt in the base case model (Figure \ref{fig:S_ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). The target spawning output  based on the biomass target ($SB_{40\%}$) is 26.6 billion eggs, which gives a catch of 21.1 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is 19.5 mt. Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_S} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the southern area model and Figure \ref{fig:S_yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium yield curve.





#Harvest Projections and Decision Tables
The forecasts of stock abundance and yield were developed using the final base models. The total catches in 2015 and 2016 are set to the PFMC adopted China rockfish contribution ACLs in the northern and central models (Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}). The southern model total catches in 2015 and 2016 are set to the average annual catch from 2012-2014. The exploitation rate for 2017 and beyond is based upon an SPR harvest rate of 50%, adjusted by the default 40-10 harvest control rule. The average of 2010-2014 catch by fleet was used to distribute catches in forecasted years.


**Northern Model**
Current medium-term projections of expected China spawning biomass from the northern base model suggests slight declines from the current levels as the stock moves towards the current target stock size under the default  harvest control rule (Table \ref{tab:Forecast_N}, Figures \ref{fig:forecast_compare2_spawnbio_uncertainty} and \ref{fig:forecast_compare4_Bratio_uncertainty}). The stock is expected to remain above the target stock size during the projection period, assuming stationarity in the stock-recruitment assumptions. 

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the three states of nature agreed upon at the STAR panel and are based on a low value of M, 0.05, and a high value, 0.09. Current medium-term forecasts based on the alternative states of nature project that the stock, under the current control rule as applied to the base model, will decline towards the target stock size Table \ref{tab:decision_table_north}. The current control rule under the low state of nature results in a stock decline into the precautionary zone, while the high state of nature maintains the stock at near unfished levels. Removing the catches resulting from the low M state of nature, assuming the base and high values of M both maintain the stock at well above the current target stock size, as does removing the recent average catches under all states of nature. Removing the high M catches under the base model M and high M states of nature results in the population going to extremely low levels during the projection period, spawning biomass and stock depletion values are not reported for years in which the stock goes to these very low levels. 


**Central Model** 

Current medium-term projections of expected China spawning biomass from the central base model suggests stable catches near current levels as the stock is just above the current target stock size under the default harvest control rule (Table \ref{tab:Forecast_C}, Figures \ref{fig:forecast_compare2_spawnbio_uncertainty} and \ref{fig:forecast_compare4_Bratio_uncertainty}). The stock is expected to remain just above the target stock size, increasing slightly, during the projection period, assuming stationarity in the stock-recruitment assumptions. 

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the three states of nature agreed upon at the STAR panel and are based on a low value of M, 0.05, and a high value, 0.09. Current medium-term forecasts based on the alternative states of nature project that the stock, under the current control rule as applied to the base model, will decline towards the target stock size Table \ref{tab:decision_table_central}. The current control rule under the low state of nature results in a stock in the precautionary zone, while the high state of nature maintains the stock increasing from 40% to 50% depletion from 2017 - 2026.  Removing the catches resulting from the low M state of nature, assuming the base and high values of M both maintain the stock at well above the current target stock size.  Removing the high M catches under the base model M and low M states of nature results in the population going to extremely low levels during the projection period.  Removing average catches under the base M and high M states of nature result in the stock remaining above the current target stock size, and an ending depletion of 37% in 2026 for the low M state of nature.

**Southern Model**

Assuming that catches in 2015 and 2016 equal recent average catch, and that catches beginning in 2017 follow the default ACL harvest control rule, projections of expected China spawning output from the southern base model suggest the stock will be at roughly 30% of unfished spawning output in 2017, and increase to 38% by 2026 (Table \ref{tab:Forecast_S}, Figures \ref{fig:forecast_compare2_spawnbio_uncertainty} and \ref{fig:forecast_compare4_Bratio_uncertainty}). The stock is expected to remain below the target stock size (40% of unfished spawning output) in the base model and “low M” states of nature through 2026, and to exceed target size in the “high M” scenario, assuming stationarity in the stock-recruitment assumptions.

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the three states of nature agreed upon at the STAR panel: a low value of M, 0.05, the base model value, M=0.07, and a high value, M=0.09. Stock status under the alternative states of nature ranges from an overfished state in 2017 for the low-M scenario (21% of unfished spawning output) to a stock at target biomass (40% of unfished) in the high-M scenario (Table \ref{tab:decision_table_south}). Annual catches based on the low-M state of nature increase from 5 to 10 mt over the projection period, and result in an increasing stock under all three states of nature. Catches derived from the base model increase from 11 mt in 2017 to 15 mt in 2026, and also produce increasing trends (at different rates) in spawning output under all three states of nature. Catches under the high-M state of nature produce very little change in spawning output over the projection period for all three states of nature.


#Regional Management Considerations
China rockfish is currently managed as part of the nearshore rockfish stock complex, and as such, does not have a species-specific ACL. The complex is divided into northern and southern components around the PFMC management line at $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude (near Cape Mendocino, California). This management boundary is consistent with observed spatial patterns in the data (e.g. length compositions, size at age, commercial discard rates), and OFL estimates for the northern and southern management regions can be calculated directly from the base model runs and projections (southern model = OFL for southern nearshore rockfish complex, central + northern models = OFL for northern nearshore rockfish complex).


#Research Needs
\begin{enumerate}

\item The number of hours fished in Washington should be recorded for each dockside sample (vessel) so that future CPUE can be measured as angler hours rather than just number of anglers per trip. This will allow for a more accurate calculation of effort.

\item The number of hours fished in Oregon should be recorded for each dockside sample (vessel), instead of the number of the start and end times of the entire trip.  This will allow for a more accurate calculation of effort.

\item Compare the habitat-based methods used to subset data for the onboard observer indices to Stephens-MacCall and other filtering methods.

\item Explore the sensitivity of Stephens-MacCall when the target species is “rare” or not common encountered in the data samples.

\item A standardized fishery independent survey sampling nearshore rockfish in all three states would provide a more reliable index of abundance than the indices developed from catch rates in recreational and commercial fisheries. However, information value of such surveys would depend on the consistency in methods over time and space and would require many years of sampling before an informative index could be obtained.

\item A coastwide evaluation of genetic structure of China rockfish is a research priority. Genetic samples should be collected at sites spaced regularly along the coast throughout the range of the species to estimate genetic differences at multiple spatial scales (i.e., isolation by distance).
 
\item Difficulties were encountered when attempting to reconstruct historical recreational catches at smaller spatial scales, and in distinguishing between landings from the private and charter vessels. Improved methods are needed to allocate reconstructed recreational catches to sub-state regions within each fishing mode.

\item There was insufficient time during the STAR Panel review to fully review the abundance indices used in the China rockfish assessments. Consideration should be given to scheduling a data workshop prior to STAR Panel review for review of assessment input data and standardization procedures for indices, potentially for all species scheduled for assessment.  The nearshore data workshop, held earlier this year, was a step in this direction, but that meeting did not deal with the modeling part of index development.
 
\item The Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) index in Oregon was excluded from the assessment model because it was learned that multiple intercept interviews were done for a single trip. Evaluate whether database manipulations or some other approach can resolve this issue and allow these data to be used in the assessment. 
 
\item Many of the indices used in the China rockfish assessment model used the Stephens-MacCall (2004) approach to subset the CPUE data. Research is need to evaluate the performance of the method when there are changes in management restrictions and in relative abundance of different species. Examination of the characteristics of trips retained/removed should be a routine part of index standardization, such as an evaluation of whether there are time trends in the proportion of discarded trips.
 
\item Fishery-dependent CPUE indices are likely to be the only trend information for many nearshore species for the foreseeable future.  Indices from a multi-species hook-and-line fishery may be influenced by regulatory changes, such as bag limits, and by interactions with other species (e.g. black rockfish) due to hook competition.  It may be possible to address many of these concerns if a multi-species approach is used to develop the indices, allowing potential interactions and common forcing to be evaluated.
 
\item Consider the development of a fishery-independent survey for nearshore stocks. As the current base model structure has no direct fishery-independent measure of stock trends, any work to commence collection of such a measure for nearshore rockfish, or use of existing data to derive such an index would greatly assist with this assessment.
 
\item Basic life history research may help to resolve assessment uncertainties regarding appropriate values for natural mortality and steepness.
 
\item Examine length composition data of discarded fish from recreational onboard observer programs in California and Oregon. Consider modeling discarded catch using selectivity and retention functions in Stock Synthesis rather than combining retained and discarded catch and assuming they have identical size compositions. Another option would be to model discarded recreational catch as a separate fleet, similar to the way commercial discards were treated in the southern model.
 
\item Ageing data were influential in the China rockfish stock assessments. Collection and ageing of China rockfish otoliths should continue.  Samples from younger fish not typically selected by the fishery are needed to better define the growth curve.
 
\item Consider evaluating depletion estimators of abundance using within season CPUE indices.  This approach would require information on total removals on a reef-by-reef basis.
 
\item The extensive use of habitat information in index development is a strength of the China rockfish assessment. Consideration should be given to how to further incorporate habitat data into the assessment of nearshore species.  The most immediate need seems to be to increase the resolution of habitat maps for waters off Oregon and Washington, and standardization of habitat data format among states.
 
\item Although all the current models for China rockfish estimated implausibly large recruitment deviations when allowed to do so, particularly early in the modeled time period, further exploration of available options in stock synthesis could produce acceptable results. In addition, this work may provide guidance on any additional options that could be added to stock synthesis to better handle this situation. For example, assuming different levels autocorrelation in the stock-recruit relationship for data-moderate stocks may help curb the tendency to estimate extreme recruitment with sparse datasets.
 
\item Research is needed on data-weighting methods in stock assessments. In particular, a standard approach for conditional age-at-length data is needed.  The Center for the Advancement of Population Assessment Methodology (CAPAM) data weighting workshop, scheduled for later this year, should make important progress on this research need.

The 1987-1998 CDFW onboard observer program did not record the number of anglers at a fishing stop from 4/22/87 until 7/9/92. 
The goal of this analysis is to impute the number of observed anglers in the initial period of the sampling program from the number of observed anglers and onboard anglers from the later years of the program.

The number of observed anglers at a fishing stop is a subset of the number of total 
number of anglers onboard the vessel (paid plus free anglers); a quantity which is consistently 
recorded throughout the entire dataset.  We explored the using the total number of observed anglers onboard
the vessel in the following analyses, but it was not recorded in a consitent manner through time, e.g., recorded as
the maximum number of anglers observed at a fishing stop during the trip, a sum of the observed anglers at each
fishing stop, or the average number of observed anglers at all fishings stops, etc.

We explored a binomial regression model to predict 
the mean number of observed anglers at a fishing stop from the number of total anglers, in the 
initial period of the data. Binomial regression models of this general form were 
considered in this analysis, as well as a sensitivity analysis among the other 
potential covariates available in the dataset. Among the potential predictor 
variables in this study, effects related to the interviewer, and trip date 
were considered for inclusion in 
the final model by pairwise comparison of fitted model AIC values as well as 
analysis of parameter significance.

Effects related to interviewer were found to be very significant, although due 
to the high turn-over rate of the interviewers in these data, interviewer 
specific effects are not useful for prediction here. However, the total number 
of interviewers onboard the vessel (one or two interviewers) was found to be strongly 
significant and was included in the final models as a categorical effect.


For imputing the observed number of observed anglers for the early period of the 
dataset it is important to motivate an assumption of stationarity in the number 
of observed anglers through time. Thus trip date was considered for inclusion in 
the model to check for any possibility significance through time. Firstly, date 
was considered for inclusion in the model as a discrete time variable; secondly, 
a separate model was tested using only year as categorical variable to consider 
any temporal patterns. Given the number of total anglers, neither of the models 
considering temporal effects were able demonstrate that the number of observed 
anglers varied significantly through time. All models which included temporal 
effects produced higher overall AIC values, thus supporting the assumption of 
stationarity in time.


Log Model:
\begin{equation}
y_{ij} \sim \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} \log(x_{ij}) + \epsilon_{ij} ~~~ \epsilon_{ij} \sim N( 0, \sigma_j )
\end{equation}

![The number of observed anglers plotted as a function of the number of total anglers. The log-normal mean curves are plotted on the scale of the data, and colored to indicate if the data was collected in the presence of one or two interviewers. Additionally, a total anglers rug plot is included to show the total angler data for which the number of observed anglers needs to be imputed. \label{obsAngLogModel}](plots/obsAngLogModel.pdf)


Binomial Log Model:
\begin{equation}
y_{ij} \sim B\Big( ~N_{ij}, ~\text{logit}\big(\beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} \log(x_{ij})\big)~ \Big)
\end{equation}

The log model considers a typical normal linear model for each interviewer 
level, except it uses the log of the number of total anglers as a predictor 
rather than the raw numbers of total anglers. The log model has several nice 
features for prediction in this case. Firstly by regressing on the log of the 
total anglers it improves the correlation and relative homoscedasticity of the 
joint data and improves the accuracy of sensitivity analysis by improving the 
standard error estimates for each parameter. Secondly the log transformation 
introduces the expected mean prediction shape, by emphasizing order of magnitude 
differences in the total number of anglers. The binomial log model considers the 
observed angler counts as independent draws from a binomial given the know 
number of total anglers. The log transformation in the binomial case is 
justified over the traditional binomial glm for similar reasons as the normal 
log model, as well as simple AIC support of the transformation. All models and 
model selection criterion were computed using the standard \verb|glm| function 
in the R software environment for statistical computing [@rBase].


The binomial log model was chosen for its low AIC value and reasonable mean 
predictions. Untransformed binomial models were considered, however they produce 
unreasonable observed angler predictions associated with the high numbers of 
total anglers. The log transformed Normal model provides mostly reasonable 
predictions, but is not supported by AIC when compared to the binomial models. 
Additionally transforms of Normal likelihood models have no distributional way 
of producing observed angler predictions which do not exceed the total number of 
anglers. If a Normal likelihood model were to gather AIC support, predictions 
may require truncation. These data contain considerable noise, likely due to the 
high interviewer turnover rate, which would most effectively be modeled by 
including appropriate additional predictors to control for these effects. At 
this point no additional predictors from this dataset were considered to be 
both sensitive and appropriate for use with prediction in this case.

**Reef Delineation**
We identified reefs as potential habitat for China rockfish in California, Oregon and Washington using a variety of newly available spatial data sources, including 2, 3 and 5 m bathymetry, substrate, lithology and Habitat Suitability geodatabases.  Available data sources varied by latitude. To delineate reefs from Point Conception to the Oregon border we used a 2 m binary raster layer (3 m for Cordell Bank) for substrate, where 1 = rough, and 0 = smooth habitat (California Seafloor Mapping Project "Tier 2" GIS Products, accessed 03.18.2013, data available from: http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html).  Rough and smooth substrate was identified by CSMP using 2 rugosity indices based upon bathymetric data, surface:planar area (SA:PA), and vector ruggedness measure (VRM).  We considered areas identified as ‘rough’ as reef habitat.  For reefs named Asilomar, Cypress Point, Portuguese Ledge, and Point Joe only a portion of the reefs were mapped at the 2 m resolution, therefore to identify the remaining reef, we used either a 5 m resolution VRM dataset, where the VRM cutoff was greater than 0.001 [@Young2010].  For all reefs derived from either 2 m, 3 m or 5 m resolution, we applied a 5 m buffer around each reef habitat for potential error in positional accuracy and all reefs with an area greater than or equal to 100 m\textsuperscript{2} were included. We identified seven reefs outside of the 2 m layer that contained a significant number of CPFV points, which we decided to include in the indices.  Big Reef, Blunts Reef, Isle of St. James, Point Sur Deep, Sandhill Ledge, portions of San Gregario  and Soap Bank reefs were located just outside of 2 m, 3 m and 5 m ‘footprint’, therefore for these reefs we used the 2005 Habitat Suitability Probability (HSP) geodatabase for China rockfish [@NMFS2005]. The HSP is a modeled output from Essential Fish Habitat geodatabase and is based upon habitat data, depth, and location, where input data are NMFS trawl datasets. In order to identify reef habitats from the Oregon border to Washington, we used a lithology shapefile [@Goldfinger2014] that was based upon multiple seafloor mapping surveys including multibeam and sidescan sonar, sediment grab and core samples, and images. Seafloor types were classified according to established classification schemes [@Greene1999].  We considered the following lithology types as ‘reef habitat:’ Boulder, cobble, cobble mix, hard, rock, and rock mix.  All spatial data was projected to NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10.


Reef systems were grouped and stratified by depth at a spatial scale biologically meaningful to China rockfish.  China rockfish are typically sedentary and have high site fidelity, therefore we grouped reefs in consideration of how a China rockfish would experience its surroundings.  Lea [-@Lea1999] recaptured China rockfish in the same general location as where they were released, however a few individuals of other rockfish species (copper (\textit{Sebastes caurinus}), gopher (\textit{Sebastes carnatus}), olive (\textit{Sebastes serranoides}) and yellowtail (\textit{Sebastes flavidus})) demonstrated movement up to 1.5 nautical miles (about 2,700 m), but all were captured within the same reef system.  In the Puget Sound copper, brown and quillback were found to have a home range less than 30m\textsuperscript{2} in high relief rocky areas [@Matthews1990].  In other rockfish movement studies, China rockfish were tagged but never recaptured, or there was a sample size of 1 [@Hannah2011], Hannah 2012).  Using this limited information, we considered that China rockfish would swim no more than 200 m over smooth, sand, or muddy habitat to a neighboring reef, therefore if a reef was greater than ~200 m from rocky reef habitat it was considered a different reef system.  If a reef system has contiguous habitat (no channels greater than 200 m) it remained intact, no matter how large the reef (Figures \ref{fig:MHM_careefs} and \ref{fig:MHM_orreefs}).  A small number of reefs were merged into ‘super reefs’ to accommodate 1980s-1990s CDFW location codes that overlapped multiple reefs [.  Reef areas were calculated using the zonal stats tool in ArcGIS, stratified by the depth bins 0-19 m, 20-39 m, 40-59 m, 60-79 m, 80-99 m and greater than 100 m using the CSMP depth raster (2 m, 3 m or 5 m resolution).  To get depths for those reefs outside the CSMP ‘footprint’ we used the NOAA Coastal Relief Model raster dataset (90 m) for California, and 100 m digital elevation model (DEM) bathymetry from the Active Tectonics and Seafloor Mapping Lab for Oregon.

\newpage
Regions were designated to gain appropriate sample sizes needed for modelling.  For Oregon, region differences north and south of Florence were explored.  In California, 12 regions north of Pt. Conception were defined as follows:

Region 1: Pt. Conception to Pt. Arguello  
Region 2: Purisima Point to Pt. Sal  
Region 3: San Luis Obispo Bay to Mill Creek ($39.959^\circ$ N)  
Region 4: Lopez Point to Monterey Peninsula  
Region 5: Moss Landing to San Francisco Bay  
Region 6: Farallon Islands  
Region 7: Point Bonita to Drakes Bay  
Region 8: Point Reyes to Point Arena  
Region 9: Point Arena to south of Ten Mile River  
Region 10: north of Ten Mile River to Cape Mendocino ($40.16667^\circ$ N)   
Region 11: Cape Mendocino to Eel River  
Region 12: Trinidad Head to CA/OR border  


**CPFV drift selection**
During the 1987-1998 CDFW onboard observer program, fishing location was recorded as one of 459 location codes.  When available, the observer also recorded coordinates, either latitude/longitude or Loran.  The SWFSC converted all Loran coordinates to latitude/longitude.  Using the fishing stops with available coordinates, we assigned a fishing location code to a reef.  A handful of fishing location codes were obviously not associated with a reef, or a reef as identified in the above methods, and were not selected in the final dataset.  If the coordinates spanned two reefs and we were unable to tell which reef was consistently fished for a given location code, we created aggregated the reefs.  This most commonly occurred around the Monterey Bay peninsula.  This was necessary as two-thirds of the fishing stops encountering China rockfish had no recorded coordinates and allowed us to retain all fishing location data.  Therefore, for the 1987-1998 CDFW data,  any fishing location that was assigned to a reef was included in the analyses as one of the filters applied to the data.


For each CPFV location in the California 1999-2014 and Oregon 2001-2014 data we calculated depth, nearest reef, distance from reef, nearest MPA, distance from MPA using ArcGIS.  Geoprocessing steps used were ‘near’ and ‘extract values to points.’ For consistency across databases, we used the starting location of the drift to determine if the drift was targeting fish associated with a reef.  Drifts that had a distance of 0 m, i.e., were fishing directly on the reef, were included in analyses.  Recognizing that some drifts begin adjacent to a reef with the intention of drifting on to the reef, as well as the fact that the starting location may not be recorded at the very start of a drift, we devised a method for including drifts within a certain distance of a reef.  
We compiled a list of rockfish species that are strictly reef associated (black and yellow rockfish (\textit{Sebastes chrysomelas}), canary rockfish  (\textit{Sebastes pinniger}), China rockfish (\textit{Sebastes nebulosus}), cowcod (\textit{Sebastes levis}), flag rockfish  (\textit{Sebastes rubrivinctus}), gopher rockfish (\textit{Sebastes carnatus}), grass rockfish (\textit{Sebastes rastrelliger}), greenblotched rockfish (\textit{Sebastes rosenblatti}), kelp rockfish (\textit{Sebastes atrovirens}), quillback rockfish (\textit{Sebastes maliger}), rosy rockfish (\textit{Sebastes rosaceus}), starry rockfish (\textit{Sebastes constellatus}), Treefish (\textit{Sebastes serriceps}), vermilion rockfish (\textit{Sebastes miniatus}), yelloweye rockfish (\textit{Sebastes ruberrimus})) (personal communication John Field and Tom Laidig, NMFS SWFSC).  Using drifts that were greater than 0m from a reef and encountered one at least one of the fifteen species listed above, we calculated the depth for which 75\% of the drifts were included.  For Oregon this was 83 m, and for California it was 34 m for drifts within the ‘footprint’ and 141 m for drifts outside the ‘footprint.’  Any drift (with or without catch) greater than 83 m from a reef was excluded from the analyses.

**Oregon**

The following commercial regulations pertain to China rockfish in Oregon and were provided by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.

China rockfish are managed in the Other Nearshore Rockfish complex

\textbf{Harvest cap}: Total amount in regulation allowed to be impacted in a fishery (for a given season) including both discard mortality and landed catch mortality.  Prior to 2007 this term was synonymous with “landing cap.”

\textbf{Landing cap}: Total amount in regulation allowed to be landed in a fishery (for a given season).  Includes only landed catch mortality (known as a harvest cap before 2007).  

**Incidental Catch Limits in Other Fisheries (established in 2004)**

\textbf{Non-permitted vessels}: 15 lbs per day of black rockfish, blue rockfish, and nearshore fish, combined, for no more than one landing per day.  These species must make-up 25% or less of landed poundage, and must be taken with gear legal in the permitted fishery.

\textbf{Groundfish trawl fishery}: Vessels may land no more than 1,000 lbs of dead black rockfish, blue rockfish, and nearshore fish combined per calendar year if these species make-up 25% or less of landing.

\textbf{Non-profit aquaria or vessels contracted by non-profit aquaria} may land black rockfish, blue rockfish, and nearshore fish for purposes of display or for conducting research on these species.

**Regulations History**

A minimum size limit of 12 inches (measured from the tip of the snout to the extreme end of the tail) was implemented for China rockfish in 2000.  A sorting requirement for China rockfish was implemented in 2003.

**Nearshore Fishery Bycatch Permit**
This special non-transferable permit is issued as of 2003 to those qualifying individuals who use either trawl or entangling nets (gill nets).  It allows a minimal bycatch of minor nearshore species (which includes China rockfish) as per the following:

   
   South Central Coast Region 25 pounds of nearshore fish stocks may be taken per trip

   South Coast Region – 50 pounds of nearshore fish stocks may be taken per trip
 
   No permits are issued for either the North Coast or North-Central Coast Regions.

**California**

The following regulations pertain to nearshore rockfish species in Oregon and were provided by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. In 2000, a 3-hook and 1-line gear restriction was enacted.  As of 2001, the gear restriction is 2-hooks and 1-line per angler.  The general rockfish (Rockfish/Cabezon/Greenling as of 2002) bag limit was 15 fish statewide in 1999.  As of 2000, it is 10 rockfish.  The nearshore rockfish bag limit is the same as the general rockfish bag limit except in 2003 and 2004.  In 2003, the nearshore rockfish bag limit was 2 fish south of Cape Mendocino in 2003 and for a portion of 2004.
