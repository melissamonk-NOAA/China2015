##Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
\label{sec:uncertainty}
The best approach for describing uncertainty and the range of probable biomass estimates in groundfish  assessments may depend on the situation.  
Important factors to consider include:

###Title
Parameter uncertainty (variance estimation conditioned on a given model, estimation framework, data set choice, and weighting scheme), including likelihood profiles for important assessment parameters (e.g., natural mortality).  This also includes expressing uncertainty in derived outputs of the model and estimating CVs using appropriate methods (e.g., bootstrap, asymptotic methods, Bayesian approaches, such as MCMC). Include the CV of spawning biomass in the first year for which an OFL has not been specified (typically end year +1 or +2).

###Title
Sensitivity to assumptions about model structure, i.e., model specification uncertainty

###Title
Sensitivity to data set choice and weighting schemes (e.g., emphasis factors), which may also include a consideration of recent patterns in recruitment.

###Title
Retrospective analysis, where the model is fitted to a series of shortened input data sets, with the most recent years of input data being dropped.

###Title
Historical analysis (plot of actual estimates from current and previous assessments).

###Title
Subjective appraisal of the magnitude and sources of uncertainty.

###Title
If a range of model runs is used to characterize uncertainty it is important to provide some qualitative or quantitative information about relative probability of each. If no statements about relative probability can be made, then it is important to state that all scenarios (or all scenarios between the bounds depicted by the runs) are equally likely

###Title
\label{sec:uncertaintylast}
If possible, ranges depicting uncertainty should include at least three runs: (a) one judged most probable; (b) at least one that depicts the range of uncertainty in the direction of lower current biomass levels; and (c) one that depicts the range of uncertainty in the direction of higher current biomass levels.  The entire range of uncertainty should be carried through stock projections and decision table analyses.

#Harvest Control Rules (CPS Only)

#Reference Points (Groundfish Only)
1.  Unfished spawning stock biomass, summary age biomass, and recruitment, along with unfished spawning stock output.
2. 	Reference points based on B\textsubscript{40\%} for rockfish and roundfish and on B\textsubscript{25\%} for flatfish (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).
3.	Reference points based on default SPR proxy (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).
4.	Reference points based on MSY (if estimated) (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).
5.	Equilibrium yield curve showing various BMSY proxies. 

#Harvest Projections and Decision Tables (Groundfish Only)
*Not required in draft assessment undergoing review.

1.  Harvest projections and decision tables (i.e., a matrix of alternative models (states of nature) versus management actions) should cover the plausible range of uncertainty about current stock biomass and a set of candidate fishing mortality targets used for the stock.  See section “\textit{Uncertainty and Decision Tables in Groundfish Stock Assessment}” (this document, pp. \pageref{sec:uncertainty}\-\pageref{sec:uncertaintylast}) on how to define alternative states of nature.  Management decisions in most cases represent the sequence of catches including estimate of OFL based on FMSY (or its proxy) and those obtained by applying the Council 40\-10 harvest policy to each state of nature; however other alternatives may be suggested by the GMT as being more relevant to Council decision making.  OFL calculations should be based on the assumption that future catches equal ABCs and not OFLs.

2.  Information presented should include biomass, stock depletion, and yield projections of OFL, ABC and ACL for ten years into the future, beginning with the first year for which management action could be based upon the assessment.


#Regional Management Considerations
1. For stocks where current practice is to allocate harvests by management area, a recommended method of allocating harvests based on the distribution of biomass should be provided.  The MT advisor should be consulted on the appropriate management areas for each stock.

2. Discuss whether a regional management approach makes sense for the species from a biological perspective.

3. If there are insufficient data to analyze a regional management approach, what are the research and data needs to answer this question?

Beginning in 1992 Calrec Historic began tracking the number of observed anglers in its database, however the full data-set spans from 4/22/87 until 12/31/98. 
The goal of this analysis is to impute the number of observed anglers in the 
initial period of the dataset, from 4/22/87 until 7/9/92, when the observed 
number of active anglers was not yet being recorded.

<!>
<!>

The number of observed anglers is necessarily a subset of the number of total 
anglers; a quantity which is consistently recorded throughout the entire dataset. 
This suggests that a simple binomial regression model could be used to predict 
the mean number of observed anglers from the number of total anglers, in the 
initial period of the data. Binomial regression models of this general form were 
considered in this analysis, as well as a sensitivity analysis among the other 
potential covariates available in the dataset. Among the potential predictor 
variables in this study, effects related to the interviewer, trip date, and the 
trip's identification number (trip ID) number were considered for inclusion in 
the final model by pairwise comparison of fitted model AIC values as well as 
analysis of parameter significance.

<!>
<!>

Effects related to interviewer were found to be very significant, although due 
to the high turn-over rate of the interviewers in these data, interviewer 
specific effects are not useful for prediction here. However, the total number 
of present interviewers (one or two interviewers) was found to be strongly 
significant and was included in the final models as a categorical effect.

<!>
<!>

For imputing the observed number of active anglers for the early period of the 
dataset it is important to motivate an assumption of stationarity in the number 
of observed anglers through time. Thus trip date was considered for inclusion in 
the model to check for any possibility significance through time. Firstly, date 
was considered for inclusion in the model as a discrete time variable; secondly, 
a separate model was tested using only year as categorical variable to consider 
any temporal patterns. Given the number of total anglers, neither of the models 
considering temporal effects were able demonstrate that the number of observed 
anglers varied significantly through time. All models which included temporal 
effects produced higher overall AIC values, thus supporting the assumption of 
stationarity in time.

<!>
<!>

Trip ID was found to contribute a significant effect toward overall inference. 
Upon further investigation, trip ID was found to encode information about the 
number of consecutive outings for each interviewer followed by a decimal point 
and a unique numeric code for each interviewer. This suggests that by ignoring 
the numbers after the decimal point one could represent a measure of the generic 
interviewer experience. Inclusion of this variable was tested and is supported 
by the fitted AIC and parameter significance as a discrete experience variable. 
Although this variable was supported by the chosen model selection criteria, it 
was ultimately left out of the final models for further investigation of 
accuracy of the coding scheme.

The log model considers a typical normal linear model for each interviewer 
level, except it uses the log of the number of total anglers as a predictor 
rather than the raw numbers of total anglers. The log model has several nice 
features for prediction in this case. Firstly by regressing on the log of the 
total anglers it improves the correlation and relative homoscedasticity of the 
joint data and improves the accuracy of sensitivity analysis by improving the 
standard error estimates for each parameter. Secondly the log transformation 
introduces the expected mean prediction shape, by emphasizing order of magnitude 
differences in the total number of anglers. The binomial log model considers the 
observed angler counts as independent draws from a binomial given the know 
number of total anglers. The log transformation in the binomial case is 
justified over the traditional binomial glm for similar reasons as the normal 
log model, as well as simple AIC support of the transformation. All models and 
model selection criterion were computed using the standard \verb|glm| function 
in the R software environment for statistical computing \cite{rBase}.

<!>
<!>

The binomial log model was chosen for its low AIC value and reasonable mean 
predictions. Untransformed binomial models were considered, however they produce 
unreasonable observed angler predictions associated with the high numbers of 
total anglers. The log transformed Normal model provides mostly reasonable 
predictions, but is not supported by AIC when compared to the binomial models. 
Additionally transforms of Normal likelihood models have no distributional way 
of producing observed angler predictions which do not exceed the total number of 
anglers. If a Normal likelihood model were to gather AIC support, predictions 
may require truncation. These data contain considerable noise, likely due to the 
high interviewer turnover rate, which would most effectively be modeled by 
including appropriate additional predictors to control for these effects. At 
this point no additional predictors from this dataset were considered to be 
both sensitive and appropriate for use with prediction in this case.
