##Data and assessment{-}
China rockfish was assessed as a data moderate stock in 2013 using the X-DBSRA modeling framework [@Cope2013].  This assessment uses the newest version of Stock Synthesis (3.24v).  

The data used in the assessments includes, landings, length and age compositions of the retained

The assessment model begins in 19xxx, and assumes the stock was at an unfished equilibrium in 19xx.

##Ecosystem considerations{-}
In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in the analysis.  This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the
assessment.

However, we did use recently available habitat information to select the data used in the onboard observer indices of relative abundance....? 

##Reference points{-}
Reference points and quantities for the China rockfish base case model.  Prior to the 2011-12 PFMC management cycle, China rockfish did not have a component OFL.  Dick and MacCall [-@Dick2010] estimated OFLs for China rockfish using Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis.  The OFL was adopted by PFMC for the 2012-12 and 013-14 management cycles.

#Introduction

##Basic Information and Life History

China rockfish \emph{Sebastes nebulosus} is a medium-sized, commercially (mainly in the live-fish
fishery) and recreationally prized deeper-dwelling nearshore rockfish ranging from southern
California, north to the Gulf of Alaska [@Love2002].  Core abundance is found from northern California to
southern British Columbia, Canada. China rockfish were historically encountered by the recreational fleet in the Southern California Bight [@Love1998].  Love [-@Love1998] examined the 1980-1996 MRFSS data from southern CA.  In the early years of the study China rockfish were occasioinally enountered, and by 1996 no China rockfish were observed.  

There is limited information available on stock structure or life history.  No genetic research has been conducted for China rockfish, and no published research indicates separate stocks along the West Coast.  China rockfish do not appear to exhibit sexual dimorphism [@Lenarz1991], although the data are limited.  Fits to a von Bertallanfy growth curve from age-length data from Washington, Oregon and California used in this assessment indicate less than a 2 cm difference at the maximum length, $L_\infty$ [@vonB1938].  These data represent fish collected from the recreational and commercial sectors as well as for research.

China rockfish are among the longer-lived rockfish.  Love [-@Love2002] reports China rockfish live to at least 79 year, which is corroborated by the available age data used in this assessment. The oldest aged China rockfish from Alaska was 78 years old [@Munk2001].  Recently aged China rockfish from the West coast had a maximum age of 83 years from California (recreational or research) in 1973.  The oldest aged fish from Oregon was 79 from the commercial fisher in 2003 and in Washington, 77 years from the recreational fleet.  

Little is known about the maturity scehdule and fecundity of China rockfish.  Echeveria [-@Echeverria1987] collected 69 China rockfish, of which the age at first maturity was 3 years for males and females (26 cm).  Both males and females exhibited 50% maturity at 4 years (27 cm) and 100% maturity at 6 years (30 cm).  A study by Lea et al. [-@Lea1999] captured females releasing larvae in April and May, and spent females in April, June and October off the coast of California.   Echeveria [-@Echeverria1987] identified January - June as the months of parturition for China rockfish in north-central California, with the peak of repoductive activity in January.

One diet study indicated that China rockfish in central California predominantly feed on crustaceans and ophiuroids, while the diets of Chian rockfish in northern California was dominated by crusteaceans and mollusks [@Lea1999]. This is simialr to the diet described by Love [-@Love2002] of benthic orgnisms, including brittle stars, crabs, and shrimps.

Both juvenile and adult rockfish tend to be solitary and exhibit high site fidelity within rocky habitats. Surveys of rockfishes in \emph{Nereocystis} and \emph{Macrocystis} kelp forests observed China rockfish in only the \emph{Macrocystis} kelp forests and sighitngs within the kelp forests were rare [@Bodkin1986].  Juvenile China rockfish inhabit rocky areas and can be found in nearshore kelp beds (per comm. \hl{E.J. did you talk with Marc Carr about this}).  An experimental study with captive China rockfish found that juveniles exhibit both site fidelity and territoriality. [@Lee2009].  A tag and recapture study by Lea et al. [-@Lea1999] indicated Chian rockfish have high site fidelity.  While the did not report the exact distance from all China rockfish from the study were recaptured in the same "general locality at which they were released."  In other rockfish movement studies, China rockfish were tagged but never recaptured [@Hanan2012], or there was a sample size of one fish [@Hannah2011].  An ongoing study in Oregon has tagged and tracked seven China rockfish (personal communication Tom Calvanese, Oregon State University).  The maximum distance traveled by any of these China rockfish is xxxx.

Little is known about the mixing of juvenile China rockfish at the pelagic stage as they are not captured in the SWFSC juvenile rockfish cruise.  The 2013 assessment model treated the species as two stocks, one from Pt. Conception, CA to Cape Mendocino, CA ($40^\circ 10^\prime$ N lat.), which is also the management boundary for China rockfish.  For this assessment we explore assessment models.....


Include?

China rockfish can suffer from barotrauma.  Parker [-@Parker2006] found that China rockfish required 250 h to attain neutral buoyancy at 4 atmospheres absolute (ATA, depth equivalent of 30 m) when experiments began at the surface water pressure.

China rockfish vulnerability to overfishing is one of the highest recorded (V = 2.23) for west coast groundfishes [@Cope2011] and is not listed on the FSSI.





##Map
A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for fisheries or data collection strata is provided in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_map}.


##Ecosysem Considerations

In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in the analysis.  However, we did use infromation on the distribution of rocky habitat to inform the onboard observer proram indices of relative abundance from California and Oregon.  The onboard observer program collects location-specific encounters of China rockfish.  We overlaid the locations of China rockfish encounters with high-resolution bathymetry data to obtain a proxy of the extent of China rockfish habitat (see Appendix F for details, pp.\ref{sec:AppendixF}).

Much reserach is needed to elucidate the role of China rockfish in the ecosystem.  


##Fishery Information

China rockfish are most commonly capured by hook and line or traps.  They are rarely encountered in the trawl fishery due to the elusive behavior and affinity for rocky crevices.  Their high site fidelity and territoriality lend to the difficulty of capturing the species.

#Assessment

##Data
Data used in the China rockfish assessment are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:data_sources}.  A description of each data source is below.


###Fishery-Dependent Data: Commercial Landings

**Washington**

There are no records of China rockfish being landed by any commercial gears in Washington.  

**Oregon**

China rockfish landings from Oregon commercial fisheries were minor until twenty years ago Table \ref{tab:OR_comm_removal}, Figure \ref{fig:OR_comm_removal}).    Prior to the mid-1990’s, there were only trace landings of China rockfish from longline fisheries (i.e., less than one metric ton per year), and no landings from the trawl fisheries (based on species composition samples  obtained since the 1960’s; [@Douglas1998]).  However, landings of China rockfish rapidly increased from 1995-2000 due to the emergence of a live fish market that paid high prices for ornate rockfish, such as China rockfish (especially in Southern Oregon).  Following a peak in catch from 1998-2000, decreased landings of China rockfish during the early 2000’s coincided with new regulations designed to limit harvests from the live fish fishery, such as landings limits, permit limits, and minimum size limits [@Rodomsky2014]. 


There is a relatively high degree of confidence in the accuracy of historic China rockfish landings because comprehensive sampling of commercial landings began before the fishery for China rockfish developed.  Specifically, since 1992, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has obtained robust species composition samples from landings categories containing China rockfish at fine levels of stratification (i.e., year, quarter, gear, disposition, area caught, and market category).  Contamination, China rockfish landed into improper market categories, has been practically non-existent, presumably due to the high price differential for China rockfish (as opposed to other rockfish).  China rockfish landings since 1992 were obtained from PacFIN, which estimates species specific landings of rockfish by the above mentioned strata.


However, China rockfish landings could not be obtained from PacFIN prior to 1992 since China rockfish were not included in species composition samples (of rockfish category landings) from the longline and rod-and-reel fisheries (and thus China rockfish landings incorrectly appear as zeros in PacFIN).  Accordingly, landings of China rockfish were obtained from the commercial catch reconstruction developed by Karnowski et al. [-@Karnowski2014], whom borrowed species compositions (from earliest complete years) and applied them to market category landings from years before species compositions were obtained. 


All China rockfish landings from the Karnowski et al. [-@Karnowski2014] reconstruction were used except for those occurring from the salmon troll fishery, which were reported as 1-2 metric tons per year from the mid-1960’s to the early 1990’s.  Since a species composition had never been obtained from the market categories containing China rockfish for the salmon troll fishery, Karnowski et al. [-@Karnowski2014] borrowed species compositions from the recreational salmon fishery and applied them the commercial salmon troll fishery landings.  Although China rockfish appeared in the recreational salmon fishery landings, it was concluded at the Nearshore Stock Assessment Workshop ([Agenda Item D.8 Attachment 10](http://tinyurl.com/ndrrx9r), June 2015) that the China rockfish caught during recreational salmon trips were not caught by troll gear, but rather by jig gear from anglers who also targeted benthic rockfish species before or after trolling for salmon.  Since China rockfish are associated with rock reef habitat [@Love1998] and salmon trollers fish the surface waters for coho salmon and avoid rocky reefs when fishing for Chinook salmon (to prevent entanglement of expensive downrigger gear on rocks), it was deemed improbable that China rockfish be caught by salmon troll gear.   


**California**

The [CALCOM](http://128.114.3.187/) database was queried (May 15, 2015) for commercial landing estimates of China rockfish in California, 1969-2014. Landings were stratified by year, quarter, live/dead, market category, gear group, port complex, and source of species composition data (actual port samples, borrowed samples, or assumed nominal market category).

The majority of commercial China rockfish landings are made by vessels using hook-and-line gear (Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_1}). However, CALCOM landings estimates also include a large fraction of trawl-caught China rockfish from 1969-1988, which is unlikely given the species’ preference for rocky habitat. The reported trawl catch was mainly from the Monterey port complex and was landed in the “China rockfish” market category (258).

An analysis of species composition data from port samples in market category 258, by gear type, revealed that the sampled trawl-caught lengings contained mainly deeper-water species, including greenspotted rockfish (*Sebastes chlorostictus*), sometimes known as “chinafish.” Species landed by hook-and-line gears in the China rockfish market category, on the other hand, consisted of a mixture of nearshore species (e.g. china, quillback, gopher, black-and-yellow, and brown; Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_2}). When port samples are not available to estimate species composition in a stratum, and no samples are available to ‘borrow’ from an adjacent stratum, landings in a market category are assigned to the ‘nominal’ species category, in this case China rockfish.

Given the available species composition data from the trawl catch, and the fact that trawl gear is unlikely to be fished in China rockfish habitat, estimates of trawl-caught China rockfish were removed from the landings estimates in the current assessment. A similar analysis led to the removal of a small amount (about 5 mt) of landings by set-net and mid-water trawl gear groups.

In years prior to 1978, landing receipts are available for California but there are no associated port sample data. In CALCOM, a ratio estimator (based on the expanded landings estimates in the earliest sampled years) is used to allocate catch to species in unsampled years. In the case of China rockfish, this procedure propagated the estimates of trawl-caught China backward in time to 1969 (Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_1}). These ratio estimates of trawl-caught China rockfish were also removed from the final time series of landed catch.

The previous assessment of China rockfish [@Cope2015_Data-Moderate_Assessment] modeled two China rockfish populations, north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ North latitude (roughly Cape Mendocino). The majority of landings occurred south of Cape Mendocino, and the revised estimates are substantially lower in early years, primarily due to the removal of trawl catch (Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_3}).

California’s commercial live-fish fishery began targeting nearshore rockfish species in the mid-1980s in southern California, and condition codes (live or dead) were required on landing receipts starting in 1993 [@CalCOFI2002]. However, fish landed live are not always recorded as live landings on the landing receipts, so estimates of live landings should be viewed as a minimum estimate [@CalCOFI2002]. Live annual landings of China rockfish surpassed landings of dead fish by the late 1990s, due to the increased value of fish landed live (Table \ref{tab:OR_comm_removal}, Figure \ref{fig:EJD_CALCOM_4}).

Commercial landings of China rockfish in California from 1916-1968 were obtained from the historical reconstruction of Ralston et al. ([-@Ralston2010]; also available from the CALCOM website). Their analysis differentiates between trawl-caught landings and “other” gears. In the case of China rockfish, less than 2 mt of landings from 1916-1968 were attributed to trawl gears, and these were excluded from the assessment. The remaining “other” gear types (cumulative removals of 197 mt from 1916-1968) landed China rockfish mainly south of Cape Mendocino, with a short pulse of landings between Cape Mendocino and the California-Oregon border in the 1930s and early 1940s (Figure \ref{fig:CA_reconstruct_landings}). Due to the relatively large landing estimates south of Cape Mendocino in the early years, catches from 1900 to 1916 were interpolated with a linear ramp from 0 mt in 1900 to 6.1 mt in 1916 (the first year of commercial landings estimated by  Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010]).


###Fishery-Dependent Data: Commercial Discards

**Washington**
Discard of China rockfish likely occurred before the closure of nearshore commercial fisheries in 1995 for non-trawl gears and in 1999 for trawl gears.  However, there is no information on historical discards.  For this assessment, we assume no retention or discard of China in any commercial fisheries.

###Fishery-Dependent Data: Recreational Landings and Discards

**Washington**

Table \ref{tab:WA_rec_removal}, Figure \ref{fig:WA_rec_removal})

Historically, Washington’s coastal recreational anglers have been salmon orientated.  Most groundfish were considered “scrap fish” by anglers [@Buckley1967].  Beginning in the mid-1970s, and particularly in the wake of the 1974 Boldt Decision, salmon fishing opportunities became increasingly restrictive – seasons were shortened and daily limits were reduced.  The trend continued into the 1980s and 1990s.  In 1994, and for the first time in the state’s history, a one year moratorium on all ocean salmon fishing was implemented in response to dwindling salmon runs.  As salmon fishing opportunities waned over time, recreational and commercial fishers began shifting their interests to other species.  Many recreational coastal anglers shifted their efforts to rockfish.  Prior to declines in salmon fishing opportunities, rockfish, though rarely discarded, were generally not targeted.  The increased interest in rockfish and other groundfish can be linked directly to the decline in salmon fishing opportunities.    
The coastal recreational fleet is composed of two sectors; privately owned vessels and charter vessels.  Throughout the history of coastal charter boat fishing, Westport has remained the center of charter boat activity; however, as the salmon fishing industry declined, the charter fleet dispersed in search of more lucrative opportunities.  Many of the vessels left the state, and some moved north where rockfish fishing was perceived as being more reliable.  Even though, there are still more charter vessels operating at Westport than at Neah Bay and La Push.  
The primary focus of coastal rockfish anglers is black rockfish.  Black rockfish occur in greater abundance and closer to shore than other coastal rockfish species, and while generally regarded as a “bottom fish”, they tend not to occupy crack and crevice habitat, thus making them more susceptible to hook and line fishing.  As rockfish daily limits decreased, the likelihood of recreational anglers retaining smaller rockfish species, such as China, as part of their daily bag limit likely also decreased.
China rockfish are more common in northern Washington coast (Marine Catch Areas 3 and 4) from south of Tatoosh Island to Pt. Grenville inside of 15 fathoms and is rarely encountered south of the Point Grenville.  Makah Bay and the Umatilla reef areas seem to have the largest populations in the area (Tom Burlingame, Excel Fishing Charters, pers comm).  China Rockfish are rare off of the central Washington coast (Marine Catch Area 2) from the mouth of the Queets River to Leadbetter Point.  Some chartered vessels from Westport have gone multiple seasons without encountering any China rockfish in MCA 2 (Mark Cedergreen, Westport Charterboat Association, pers comm).  Suitable habitat is limited in MCA 1, from the mouth of the Leadbetter Point to the mouth of Columbia River. 
Washington recreational catch estimates were produced by WDFW Ocean Sampling Program.  The recreational estimates are based on a catch expansion procedure that includes a complete count of vessels leaving or entering a port and dockside angler interviews.  Dockside interview collects information on number of anglers fished, catch area, and target species.  Starting in 2002, release species and number of releases were included in the interview, fishing depth in 2005, and the use of descending device in 2012.  Shorebased fishing, other than major jetties, is not sampled and is considered negligible.  Sampling and effort count occur mainly from April to October.  Winter fishing is also considered negligible. 
We assumed an average weight of 0.88 kg/fish to convert the unit from number of fish to metric tons.  The catch is grouped by year, catch area, and boat type.


Discards-by-depth are estimated using the same catch expansion algorithm for retained catch.  This information is not available before 2002.  To extrapolate back in time, we applied proportions of releases based on ratio estimator of 2003-2007 data.  GMT’s surface mortality-by-depth was then applied to the number of released fish.  An average weight a 0.88 kg/fish was used.  Releases are group by year, catch area, and boat type.

**Oregon Sport Fishery Removals 1973-2014**

China rockfish have been a relatively minor contributor to historic Oregon sport groundfish landings (i.e., typically less than one percent of total catch), and have primarily been from   incidental catches of anglers targeting intermixed schools of suspended rockfish species (e.g., black rockfish, blue rockfish, and yellowtail rockfish).  China rockfish removals from the Oregon sport fishery ramped up relatively quickly during the 1970’s (Table \ref{tab:OR_rec_removal}, Figure \ref{fig:OR_rec_removal}), and have since ranged between two and seven metric tons every year, with considerable inter-annual variation. 

Total removals of China Rockfish from the Oregon sport fisheries were obtained from estimates produced by the Oregon Recreational Boat Survey (ORBS).  To produce total catch estimates, ORBS applies catch rates from a subsample of vessels (from dockside interviews) to total effort counts at fine levels of stratification (i.e., by week, port, fishery, and type of boat).  For estimates of landings, catch rates are verified by biologists; however, estimates of discarded mortality are based on angler-reported discards, and are further stratified by depth-dependent mortality rates associated with barotrauma.  Since nearly all mortality of China Rockfish has been from landed catch (i.e., typically less than 0.1 mt of discard mortality per year), there is relatively high degree of certainty in sport fishery removals.     

Since 2001, ORBS has produced comprehensive year-round estimates of catch and effort for all developed Oregon ports (and are available from RecFIN).  However, prior to 2001, ORBS sampling was typically only conducted at major ports during the peak months of sport fishing activity, and no estimates of catch were made for unsampled ports and times.  Accordingly, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) reconstructed historic ORBS estimates of China Rockfish to include catches from all ports and times (not yet available on RecFIN), as is done in recent years.  


The sport reconstruction addressed four spatial and temporal coverage biases identified during an external review of ORBS by the RecFIN Statistical Subcommittee [@VanVoorhees2000]: (1) “major ports” that were sampled each year were not sampled during the winter months; (2) “minor ports” were not sampled at all during some years; (3) effort counts for private boats excluded afternoon and night trips; and (4) undeveloped launch sites were never sampled (e.g., beaches).  A fifth coverage bias, shoreline and estuary boat removals, was not relevant to China rockfish since landings were typically non-existent during years when sampling occurred.  
The sport reconstruction utilized ratio estimators, based on years with complete sampling, to expand catches from years with partial sampling.  For instance, the contribution of winter catch to total catch during years with complete sampling was used to the expand catches for years with missing winter catch.  Similarly, the contribution of catch from a minor port to that of the major ports during years with complete sampling was used to expand catches of years that the minor port was not sampled.

###Fishery-Dependent Data: Oregon Commercial Logbook

The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) have required nearshore commercial fishers (both nearshore permitted vessels and open access vessels) to submit fishing logbooks since 2004.  Fisher compliance is generally high, averaging around 80\%, but has varied through time ranging from 65\% in 2007 to 95\% in recent years.  Although required to provide all requested information in the logbook per fishing gear set, there has been substantial variation in the quantity and quality of information reported in logbooks.  Responses from submitted logbooks were entered into a central database and span the years 2004 through 2013.  At the time of this assessment, 2014 logbook submissions were not fully processed and thus were not available.  A map showing positive reports of China rockfish can be found in Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_map}.

Logbook information went through several data quality filters to attain as best as possible a consistent and representative data set through time to estimate a relative abundance trend.  Results from the filtration algorithm are summarized in Table \ref{tab:OR_commlog_sample}.  Of note, only logbook submissions from black and blue rockfish permitted vessels with a nearshore endorsement were included in the analysis, because these vessels consistently fish in areas where China rockfish are encountered.  To minimize temporal variation in reporting errors (or nuances), only vessels that fished all 10 years (2004 – 2013) were deemed the most likely to provide consistent responses through time.  Operators of endorsed vessels may have changed through time.  Individual observations of catch (kg) and effort (hook hour) were at the trip level, where multi-set trips were aggregated to the trip level.  ODFW sets bimonthly trip landing limits for China rockfish and these have changed through time.  However, trip limits have not generally been breached in the subset of logbook data used for China rockfish, and thus there was no need to exclude subsequent trips.  The final subset of logbook data included 3,575 trips (14\% of the full set of logbook data) from 10 vessels (Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_sample}). 

Preliminary data analyses identified levels or limits of filtering variables in order to preserve adequate sample sizes and representative trips for China rockfish.  For example, gear type was restricted to hook and line (excluding longline gear) because this method accounted for 85\% of all sets.  The three main southernmost Oregon ports (Port Orford, Gold Beach, and Brookings) were the only locations that included a sufficient number of sets throughout the time series for nearshore endorsed vessels.  Thus, this abundance index is most representative of the nearshore in southern Oregon waters. Fishing depth at the start of a set was restricted to within 30 fathoms (54.9 m), which included more than 99\% of all sets by nearshore endorsed vessels, to ensure only CPUE in areas where China rockfish are commonly encountered was evaluated.

Covariates considered in the full model included \emph{month, vessel, port, depth, and people} (Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_pos}).  All covariates were specified as categorical variables, except depth was a continuous variable.  \emph{Depth} was included to account for general differences in bathymetry and fishing depth restrictions associated primarily with limiting catch of yelloweye rockfish.  \emph{People} were included in an attempt to control for the potential oversaturation of hooks at a given fishing location and the interaction that multi-crew trips (# fishers onboard) may have on fishing efficiency.  The selection of covariates included in final models were evaluated using standard information criterion for relative goodness of fit (AICc and BIC) in a backwards stepwise fashion, where a covariate remained in the model if model fit was improved relative to an otherwise identical model without the covariate.   

CPUE was modeled using a delta-GLM approach, where the catch occurrence (binomial) component was modeled using a logit link function and the positive catch component was modeled according to a gamma distribution with a log link function.  CPUE was calculated for each trip, where total catch was defined as the sum total of all reported retained catch (in weight) and released catch (numbers converted to weight by applying a median catch weight) and total effort was defined by hook-hours (number of hooks used multiplied by the number of hours fished).  A lognormal distribution for the positive catch component was also evaluated, but graphical summary diagnostics of model adequacy slightly favored the gamma distribution.   A delta-GLMM was also attempted to specify vessel-year interaction effects as stemming from a distribution (random effect) and to account for this added source of variation.  However, the estimation procedure was unstable for the delta-GLMM approach, resulting in overinflated CVs.    

Model selection procedures identified the covariates \emph{vessel, port, depth and people} as important, and along with the categorical \emph{year} factor of interest for the index were the variables included in both the catch occurrence and positive catch component models.  Extracted, back-transformed and bias corrected estimates of the \emph{year} effect were used for the abundance index (Table \ref{tab:OR_commlog}, Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog}). A jackknife resampling routine was conducted to estimate the standard error (and CV) of the \emph{year} effects.  A jackknife resampling routine was conducted to estimate the standard error (and CV) of the year effects.  The relative effects of each covariate are shown in Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_covall} for the catch occurrence component and Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_covpos} for the positive catch component.  Standard model diagnostics show adequate fit and general consistency with GLM model assumptions for the positive catch component (Figure \ref{fig:OR_commlog_diag}).



###Fishery-Dependent Data: Recreational Dockside Surveys

**Washington**

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) provided recreational dockside fisheries data from 1981 to 2014. These data went through several data quality filters to identify the best subset of the available data that are likely to be consistent over the time series and provide a representative relative index of abundance once standardized. Sample sizes from data filtering steps resulted in 10,248 records applying the Stephens-MacCall data filter [@Stephens2004] and 54,285 without applying the Stephens-MacCall data filter (Table \ref{tab:WA_dock_sample}) for use in a delta-GLM CPUE standardization. The Stephens-MacCall method is an objective approach for identifying trip records of catch and effort data when fishing locations are unknown, based inference regarding the species composition of the catch identifying habitats where the target species is likely to occur [@Stephens2004]. 
Covariates considered in the full model included \emph{Year, Month, Boat type, Bag limits, and Depth restrictions} (Figure \ref{fig:WA_dock_summary}).  All covariates were specified as categorical variables. The stepwise selection of covariates included in the final model was evaluated using standard information criterion for relative goodness of fit (AIC). \emph{Depth} was not included in the analysis because it was not uniformly recorded through time, depth data collection began during 2003. The covariates for \emph{Bag limits} and \emph{Depth restrictions} represent management changes. Summer fishing restrictions were limited to depths $\leq{20}$ fathoms in WDFW fishery areas 3 and 4 (northern WA) beginning in 2006 . In WDFW area 2 summer fishing was restricted to depths $\leq{30}$ fathoms beginning in 2006. The daily rockfish limits was 15 fish from 1961-1991, 12 fish from 1992-1994, and reduced to 10 fish in 1995 (see Appendix H for the history of recreational regulations, p.\ref{sec:AppendixH}).

CPUE was modeled using a delta-GLM approach, where the catch occurrence (binomial) component was modeled using a logit link function and the positive catch component was modeled according to a lognormal distribution with a log link function. Data are collected at the trip level, with the number of fish landed and the number of anglers on each vessel being recorded. The amount of time fished by each angler is not recorded. Therefore, the units for CPUE are fish landed/angler. A gamma distribution for the positive catch component was also explored, but model selection favored the lognormal model, although both models provided similar results. 

Model selection procedures selected the covariates \emph{Month} and \emph{Boat type} as important for both the catch occurrence and positive catch component models, and along with the categorical year factor used for the index of abundance (Tables \ref{tab:WA_dock_aic1} and \ref{tab:WA_dock_aic2}).  A bootstrap analysis (N=500) was used to estimate the standard errors (and CVs) of the year effects (Table \ref{tab:WAdock}). Standard model diagnostics show adequate fit and general consistency with GLM model assumptions for the positive catch component Figures \ref{fig:WA_dock_diagSM} and \ref{fig:WA_dock_gamma}).

Due to the large number of records filtered out by the Stephens-MacCall method a model sensitivity was run skipping the Stephens-MacCall data filtering step (Table \ref{tab:WA_dock_samplet}). The alternative index trend is very similar to the index produced with the Stephens-MacCall filter through the mid-2000s (Table \ref{tab:WAdock}). However the index using the Stephens-MacCall filter trends strongly up, whereas the index without the Stephens-MacCall filter declines from the late 2000s to present. 
Additional model sensitivities that did not impact the standardized index were:  

1.The use of only area 4 data versus using all of the data with an area covariate. A strong majority of the positive data are from area 4, only these data are used in the standardized indices. 

2.Splitting the time series in 2002 to model CPUE from 2002 to 2014 as total catch (discarded fish were recorded beginning in 2002) rather than landed catch.

Producing a model for just southern areas (1 and 2) was not successful due to a lack of positive data over the time series. 


**Oregon**

For the Oregon sport fisheries, two indices of abundance were used in the assessment: (1) catch rates from the observed charter program and (2) catch rates from the dockside survey component of the ORBS (Oregon Recreational Boat Survey).  For the observed charter index, all data elements were verified by a biologist, and thus there was a high degree of certainty in the catch, effort, and locations fished; however, there was limited spatial-temporal coverage and only charter boats were included (not private boats).  In contrast, the ORBS dockside survey had more comprehensive coverage and much greater samples sizes (i.e., 50-70 times more trips than observed charter program), but there was less confidence in the data elements, as only catch and the number of anglers were verified by biologists (all other trip details were angler-reported).  

Catch rates obtained from the dockside survey component of ORBS (Oregon Recreational Boat Survey) were used as an index of abundance for China Rockfish.  In order to provide estimates of total catch and effort for the Oregon sport fisheries, ORBS obtains catch rates from a portion of vessels via a dockside survey, and applies them to total effort counts.  During the dockside survey, biologists intercept vessels returning from fishing trips and record catch, effort, and other trip-related details (e.g., grid area fished, target species, depth, port, etc.).  Since catch and effort are both obtained, the dockside survey of ORBS was also used as index of abundance in this assessment.

Modifications had to be made to trip hours from the original ORBS dataset to create a standardize unit of effort.  Since trip hours in ORBS was not hours fished, rather the total duration of the trip (as measured from the time the boat crossed into the ocean until the time they were interviewed at the dock), travel times had to be determined and subtracted from trip hours in order to get a standardized measure of trips hours.  Accordingly, a total distance function was created for each trip based on the river miles (distance along the navigable channel from the port to the bar (river mouth)) and ocean miles (i.e., straight distance from the river bar to the ocean grid fished, wrapping around obstructions if needed).  Total distance was then converted to travel time based on generalized vessel speeds for private (i.e., 18 mph) and charter boats (i.e., 13 mph) provided by Wayne Butler (Oregon charter captain; personal communication).  It is important to note that the original trips hours minus travel hours still does not equal hours fished because it does account for time needed to move from drift to drift; however, since the number of resets between drifts would be expected to be related to fish abundance (as with catch rates), the modified trips hours was deemed a viable effort unit for the assessment.  

Trips were also removed from the ORBS dockside index that were also sampled by the Oregon onboard observer program.  The onboard observer program data is at a much finer scale than the trip-based dockside data; therefore, we chose to retain all onboard observer trips.

Trips that had erroneous trips hours as entered on paper and then entered electroinically later. These were the steps taken to correct the issue:
1. Trip hours is computed automically by the data logger based on the time the interview is entered electronically 
2. If samplers write their interviews on paper and enter them electronically later when they have time (as believed to have happened despite being instructed not to), then the trip hours are overly inflated
3. To potentially remove these errors, we computed time intervals between interviews.  Pulses of interviews a minute or two apart are very likely to have been from bunches of paper interviews entered at electronically in one sitting, as normal interviews are somewhat sporadic and take more than a minute to complete.


**California**

###Fishery-Dependent Data: Recreational Onboard Observer Surveys 
The goal of the Observer Programs in California and Oregon is to collect data including charter boat fishing locations, catch and discard of observed fish by species, and lengths of discarded fish.  Both states sample the commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV),i.e., charter boat or for-hire fleet.  The onboard observer programs collect drift-specific information at each fishing stop on an observed trip.  At each fishing stop recorded information includes start and end times, start and end location (latitude/longitude), start and end depth, number of observed anglers (a subset of the total anglers), and the catch (retained and discarded) by species of the observed anglers.  Data for the onboard observer indices for the recreational CPFV fleet are from four sampling programs.  

The California Department of Fisheries and Wildlife (CDFW) conducted an onboard observer program in central California from 1987-1998 (Reilly et al. 1998).  These data were previously used in the 2013 data moderate assessments [@Cope2015_Data-Moderate_Assessment], at the level of a fishing trip.  Since the 2013 assessments, the original data sheets were acquired and data were keypunched to the level of fishing stop.  One caveat of this data is that location data were recorded at a finer scale than the catch data.  We aggregated the relevant location information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch information.  Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the vessel is available.  We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing stop form the August 1998-December 1998 data (see Appendix E for details, pp.\pageref{sec:AppendixE}).  In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore excluded from the analysis.

California implemented a coastwide sampling program in 1999 [@Monk2014].  Cal Poly has conducted an independent onboard sampling program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay [@Stephens2006], but follows the protocols established in Reilly et al. (1998), and modified to reflect sampling changes that CDFW has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are landed instead of at the level of a fisher’s bag.  Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2014.

We generated separate relative indices of abundance in California for the 1987-1999 and 2000-2014 datasets due to the number of regulation changes occurring throughout the time period (see Appendix H, pp.\pageref{sec:AppendixH}).  CDFW implemented a regulation of three hooks in 2000, which was reduced to (and remains at) two hooks in 2001.

The Oregon Department of Fisheries and Wildlife (ODFW) initiated an onboard observer program in 2001, which became a yearly sampling program in 2003 [@Monk2013].  Both California and Oregon provided onboard sampling data through 2014.  


All indices were standardized using a delta-GLM modeling approach [@Lo1992].  Data were analyzed at the drift level and catch was taken to be the sum of observed retained and discarded fish, i.e., number of fish encountered per angler hour.  The onboard observer data from the CDFW 1999-2014 data between north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ and the Oregon border were too sparce to include in the index.  Therefore, indices used in the model with a break at $40^\circ 10^\prime$ remain the same as the state-specific onboard observer indices.

*Data Filtering*
\label{sec:onboard_datafilter}
Prior to any analyses, a preliminary data filter was applied.  

Trips/drifts from the CDFW 1988-1998 meeting the following criteria were excluded from analyses:    
1. Drift associated with a fishing location code that was not assigned to a reef    
2. Drifts identified as having possible erroneous location, observed anglers, or time data    
3. Trips encountering <50% groundfish species    

Trips/drifts from the ODFW, CDFW 1999-2014, and Cal Poly databases meeting the following criteria were excluded from analyses:    
1. ODFW halibut-targeted trips were excluded  
2. Drifts south of Pt. Conception (only 2 China rockfish observed south of Pt. Conception)
3. Trips encountering <50% groundfish species     
4. Drifts within the current Stonewall Bank Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation      
5. Drifts within Arcata Bay, Humboldt Bay, South Bay, or San Francisco Bay      
6. Drifts missing a starting location (latitude/longitude)      
7. Drifts identified as having possible erroneous location or time data     
8. Drifts missing both starting and ending depths       
9. Drifts within the habitat data occurring farther than 83 m from a reef in Oregon and 34 m in California (see Appendix F (\pageref{sec:AppendixF}) for details)      
10.	Drifts outside the habitat data in California occurring farther than 141 m from reef (see Appendix F (\pageref{sec:AppendixF}) for details)     
11.	Drifts occurring on a reef with <3 positive encounters of black rockfish      
12.	Drifts occurring on a reef in which black rockfish was observed in <25\% of years the reef was visited.     



**Index standardization: Oregon**

At the March 2015 Nearshore Stock Assessments Workshop the issue of hook saturation by black rockfish \emph{Sebastes melanops} in Oregon was raised ([Agenda Item D.8 Attachment 10](http://tinyurl.com/ndrrx9r), June 2015).  The recreational fishery in Oregon specifically targets black rockfish.  While black rockfish associate with rocky habitat, they are a schooling, midwater species.  Fishermen specifically targeting black rockfish may not drop their lines to the seafloor, or may encounter black rockfish and other midwater species before their lines can reach the seafloor.  To address this issue in the onboard observer data, we filtered out drifts for which the catch (retained plus discarded) consisted of at least 95\% black, blue \emph{Sebastes mystinus} and yellowtail \emph{Sebastes flavidus} rockfishes, the most commonly occurring midwater rockfish species.  This resulted in a decrease in the number of drifts by 4,092, only three of which observed China rockfish.  

The filtered dataset included 6,038 drifts, of which 259 (4\%) drifts with positive encounters.  The majority of drifts sampled (75\%) were from north of Florence, although China rockfishw were present in 6\% of drifts in southern Oregon and 3\% of drifts in the north. To increase sample sizes data from waves 2 and 3 were aggregated as well as from 4 and 5 (ODFW does not sample in waves 1 and 6).  Depths greater than 20 m were also binned to 20-59 m.

The selected data contained categorical variables for \emph{year} (13 levels), WAVE (2 levels), \emph{region} (2 levels, north and south of Florence), and three depth bins (\emph{depth}: 0-19 m, and 20-59 m). A lognormal model was selected over a gamma for the positive encounters by a deltaAIC of 20.01. Model selection, using AIC, selected a lognormal model with \emph{year, wave, depth, region}, and a \emph{wave:depth} interaction, while a binomial with \emph{year, region}, and \emph{wave} was selected.  In the lognormal submodel, stepwise BIC retained the \emph{year}. In the binomial model, stepwise BIC retained \emph{region} and \emph{wave}. The final YEAR effects from the delta-GLM with main effects \emph{year, region}, and \emph{wave} are shown in Table \ref{tab:OR_onboard} and Figure \ref{fig:OR_onboard}). The final model suggests that relative abundance was slightly higher in southern Oregon, and in waves 4 and 5.

**Index standardization: California**

*Central California 1988-1998*

The filtered dataset included 5,557 drifts, of which 852 (15\%) drifts with positive encounters. To increase sample sizes, data from Regions 2 and 3 were aggregated as well as Regions 8 and 9.  Samples north of Ten Mile River were too sparse to reliably include in the index.

The selected data contained categorical variables for \emph{year} (13 levels), WAVE (6 levels), \emph{region} (5 levels), and four depth bins (\emph{depth}: 0-19 m, 20-39 m, 40-59 m, and 60-79 m). A lognormal model was selected over a gamma for the positive encounters by a deltaAIC of 125.06. Model selection, using AIC, selected a lognormal model with \emph{year, depth, and region}, while a binomial with \emph{year, region, depth, wave}, and a \emph{year:region} interaction was selected.  However, the standard errors of the binomial model with interactions were large, and suggested data were too sparse to explore the \emph{year:region} interaction.  For the lognormal submodel, stepwise BIC retained the \emph{depth} and \emph{region}. For the binomial submodel, stepwise BIC retained \emph{year, region}, and \emph{depth}. The final YEAR effects from the delta-GLM with main effects \emph{year, region}, and \emph{depth} are shown in Table \ref{tab:prehist_onboard} and Figure \ref{fig:prehist_onboard}).  The covariates in the final model suggest the relative abundance of China rockfish decreases with depth and increases north of Monterey, CA.


*California (north of Pt. Conception) 2000-2014*

The filtered dataset included 13,993 drifts, of which 1,403 (10\%) drifts with positive encounters.  CDFW began sampling Region 12 (Trinidad Head to the OR border) in 2008 and no trips from Region 11 (Cape Mendocino to the Eel River) were sampled from 2000-2014.  From 2008-2014, only 10 drifts encountering China rockfish were observed in Region 12.  Therefore, the following index only reflects the population south of Cape Mendocino.  Further, to increase sample sizes drifts from Regions 2 and 3 were aggregated as well as Regions 7 and 8, and Regions 9 and 10.


The selected data contained categorical variables for \emph{year} (15 levels), WAVE (6 levels), \emph{region} (6 levels), and four depth bins (\emph{depth}: 0-19 m, 20-39 m, 40-59 m, and 60-79 m). A lognormal model was selected over a gamma for the positive encounters by a deltaAIC of 115.91. Model selection, using AIC, selected a lognormal model with \emph{year, depth, and region}, while a binomial with \emph{year, region, depth}, and a \emph{year:region} interaction was selected.  However, the standard errors of the binomial model with interactions were large, and suggested data were too sparse to explore the \emph{year:region} interaction.  For the lognormal submodel, stepwise BIC retained the \emph{year} and \emph{region}. For the binomial submodel, stepwise BIC retained \emph{region}, and \emph{depth}. The final YEAR effects from the delta-GLM with main effects \emph{year, region}, and \emph{depth} are shown in Table \ref{tab:CA_onboard} and Figure \ref{fig:CA_onboard}).  The covariates in the final model suggest the relative abundance of China rockfish decreases with depth, specifically in depths greater than 59 m, and increases south to north.


###Fishery Dependent Data: Biological sampling
*Recreational: Washington (WDFW)*



Recreational length- and age- composition data were provided directly from WDFW during winter 2015. WDFW routinely collected recreational biological samples for China rockfish between 1995 and 2014, with all but one year sampled during 1979 to 1983. These composition data lack information on the number of fish sampled out of those landed in a given trip, and therefore are used without expansion to the sample level. Unexpanded recreational composition data are frequently used in west coast stock assessments for the above reason. Length and age data collected from dockside recreational samples WA are summarized by the number of fish sampled (Table \ref{tab:WA_FishD_bio}). The WA recreational length- and age- compositions are shown in \hl{Figure X R4ss data plots of WDFW comp data; caption:WDFW length- and age-composition data.}.


*PacFIN: Oregon and Californa*

Biological data from commercial fisheries for china rockfish were extracted from PacFIN (PSMFC) on May 18, 2015. Commercial landings and the biological characteristics of hook and line landings were sampled from 1995-2014 in Oregon and in 1991-2013 California. There is no commercial catch of China rockfish in the state of Washington. Currently, port biologists employed by each state fishery agency collect species-composition information and biological data from the landed catches. The monitoring programs currently in place vary between the states but are generally based on stratified, multistage sampling designs. The OR data were available by live fish fishery landings and dead fish fishery landings, but fish conditions were not available for PacFIN for the CA landings. Due to the lack of fish condition data for CA in PacFIN, the CA commercial fishery compositions were provided directly from the state, rather than from PacFIN. 

Annual commercial length- and age-frequency distributions were developed for each state for which observations were available, following the same bin structure as was used for research observations. For each fleet, the raw observations were expanded to the sample level, to allow for any fish that were not measured, then to the trip level to account for the relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained. Length and age data collected from commercial landings for OR and CA are summarized by the number of port samples (Tables \ref{tab:OR_pacfin_bio}-\ref{tab:CA_pacfin_bio}). Figure X \hl{Figure from SS} shows plots of the commercial length and age composition data.




###Fishery-Independent Data: sources considered, but not used in assessment
*Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)*

A total of 59 China rockfish were observed in 17,657 SCUBA transects conducted in the southern and central survey regions. Transects were conducted in Northern California and Oregon for two years (2010-2011), with a higher occurence of China rockfish (156 out of 956 transects).

*California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP)*

The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP), created by Rick Starr (Sea Grant and Moss Landing Marine Laboratory) and Dean Wendt (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo), monitors marine protected areas (MPAs) and gathers information useful for fisheries management.  This program has been running in Central California since 2007 and can be found at [here](https://seagrant.mlml.calstate.edu/research/ccfrp/).

Future research is planned to use catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) information from this program, comparing relative abundance indices derived from fishery-dependent (FD) and fishery-independent (FI) monitoring programs.  CCFRP data provides a time series of fishery-independent catch and effort at fixed stations, collecting information at sample sites inside and outside of MPAs spanning about 200 miles of the California coast from Point Buchon to A\~{n}o Nuevo.  This FI information, combined with our current FD information (i.e., CPFV onboard observer data), provides an opportunity for fine-scale spatial and temporal analysis of catch rates and species compositions, specifically addressing the research needs identified in nearshore rockfish stock assessments.

#Reference Points
1.  Unfished spawning stock biomass, summary age biomass, and recruitment, along with unfished spawning stock output.
2. 	Reference points based on B\textsubscript{40\%} for rockfish and roundfish and on B\textsubscript{25\%} for flatfish (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).
3.	Reference points based on default SPR proxy (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).
4.	Reference points based on MSY (if estimated) (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).
5.	Equilibrium yield curve showing various BMSY proxies. 

#Harvest Projections and Decision Tables
*Not required in draft assessment undergoing review.

1.  Harvest projections and decision tables (i.e., a matrix of alternative models (states of nature) versus management actions) should cover the plausible range of uncertainty about current stock biomass and a set of candidate fishing mortality targets used for the stock.  See section “\textit{Uncertainty and Decision Tables in Groundfish Stock Assessment}” (this document, pp. \pageref{sec:uncertainty}\-\pageref{sec:uncertaintylast}) on how to define alternative states of nature.  Management decisions in most cases represent the sequence of catches including estimate of OFL based on FMSY (or its proxy) and those obtained by applying the Council 40\-10 harvest policy to each state of nature; however other alternatives may be suggested by the GMT as being more relevant to Council decision making.  OFL calculations should be based on the assumption that future catches equal ABCs and not OFLs.

2.  Information presented should include biomass, stock depletion, and yield projections of OFL, ABC and ACL for ten years into the future, beginning with the first year for which management action could be based upon the assessment.


#Regional Management Considerations
1. For stocks where current practice is to allocate harvests by management area, a recommended method of allocating harvests based on the distribution of biomass should be provided.  The MT advisor should be consulted on the appropriate management areas for each stock.

2. Discuss whether a regional management approach makes sense for the species from a biological perspective.

3. If there are insufficient data to analyze a regional management approach, what are the research and data needs to answer this question?

The 1987-1998 CDFW oboard observer program did not record the number of anglers at a fishing stop from 4/22/87 until 7/9/92. 
The goal of this analysis is to impute the number of observed anglers in the initial period of the sampling program from the number of observed anglers and onboard anglers from the later years of the program.

<!>
<!>

The number of observed anglers at a fishing stop is a subset of the number of total 
number of anglers; a quantity which is consistently recorded throughout the entire dataset. 
This suggests that a simple binomial regression model could be used to predict 
the mean number of observed anglers from the number of total anglers, in the 
initial period of the data. Binomial regression models of this general form were 
considered in this analysis, as well as a sensitivity analysis among the other 
potential covariates available in the dataset. Among the potential predictor 
variables in this study, effects related to the interviewer, and trip date 
were considered for inclusion in 
the final model by pairwise comparison of fitted model AIC values as well as 
analysis of parameter significance.

<!>
<!>

Effects related to interviewer were found to be very significant, although due 
to the high turn-over rate of the interviewers in these data, interviewer 
specific effects are not useful for prediction here. However, the total number 
of interviewers onboard the vessel (one or two interviewers) was found to be strongly 
significant and was included in the final models as a categorical effect.

<!>
<!>

For imputing the observed number of observed anglers for the early period of the 
dataset it is important to motivate an assumption of stationarity in the number 
of observed anglers through time. Thus trip date was considered for inclusion in 
the model to check for any possibility significance through time. Firstly, date 
was considered for inclusion in the model as a discrete time variable; secondly, 
a separate model was tested using only year as categorical variable to consider 
any temporal patterns. Given the number of total anglers, neither of the models 
considering temporal effects were able demonstrate that the number of observed 
anglers varied significantly through time. All models which included temporal 
effects produced higher overall AIC values, thus supporting the assumption of 
stationarity in time.

The log model considers a typical normal linear model for each interviewer 
level, except it uses the log of the number of total anglers as a predictor 
rather than the raw numbers of total anglers. The log model has several nice 
features for prediction in this case. Firstly by regressing on the log of the 
total anglers it improves the correlation and relative homoscedasticity of the 
joint data and improves the accuracy of sensitivity analysis by improving the 
standard error estimates for each parameter. Secondly the log transformation 
introduces the expected mean prediction shape, by emphasizing order of magnitude 
differences in the total number of anglers. The binomial log model considers the 
observed angler counts as independent draws from a binomial given the know 
number of total anglers. The log transformation in the binomial case is 
justified over the traditional binomial glm for similar reasons as the normal 
log model, as well as simple AIC support of the transformation. All models and 
model selection criterion were computed using the standard \verb|glm| function 
in the R software environment for statistical computing [@rBase].

<!>
<!>

The binomial log model was chosen for its low AIC value and reasonable mean 
predictions. Untransformed binomial models were considered, however they produce 
unreasonable observed angler predictions associated with the high numbers of 
total anglers. The log transformed Normal model provides mostly reasonable 
predictions, but is not supported by AIC when compared to the binomial models. 
Additionally transforms of Normal likelihood models have no distributional way 
of producing observed angler predictions which do not exceed the total number of 
anglers. If a Normal likelihood model were to gather AIC support, predictions 
may require truncation. These data contain considerable noise, likely due to the 
high interviewer turnover rate, which would most effectively be modeled by 
including appropriate additional predictors to control for these effects. At 
this point no additional predictors from this dataset were considered to be 
both sensitive and appropriate for use with prediction in this case.

**Reef Delineation**
We identified reefs as potential habitat for China Rockfish in California, Oregon and Washington using a variety of newly available spatial data sources, including 2, 3 and 5 m bathymetry, substrate, lithology and Habitat Suitability geodatabases.  Available data sources varied by latitude. To delineate reefs from Point Conception to the Oregon border we used a 2 m binary raster layer (3 m for Cordell Bank) for substrate, where 1 = rough, and 0 = smooth habitat (California Seafloor Mapping Project, data available from: http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html).  Rough and smooth substrate was identified by CSMP using 2 rugosity indices based upon bathymetric data, surface:planar area (SA:PA), and vector ruggedness measure (VRM).  We considered areas identified as ‘rough’ as reef habitat.  For reefs named Asilomar, Cypress Point, Portuguese Ledge, and Point Joe only a portion of the reefs were mapped at the 2 m resolution, therefore to identify the remaining reef, we used either a 5 m resolution VRM dataset, where the VRM cutoff was greater than 0.001 [@Young2010].  For all reefs derived from either 2 m, 3 m or 5 m resolution, we applied a 5 m buffer around each reef habitat for potential error in positional accuracy and all reefs with an area greater than or equal to 100 m\textsuperscript{2} were included. We identified seven reefs outside of the 2 m layer that contained a significant number of CPFV points, which we decided to include in the indices.  Big Reef, Blunts Reef, Isle of St. James, Point Sur Deep, Sandhill Ledge,   portions of San Gregario  and Soap Bank reefs were located just outside of 2 m, 3 m and 5 m ‘footprint’, therefore for these reefs we used the 2005 Habitat Suitability Probability (HSP) geodatabase for China Rockfish [@NMFS2005]. The HSP is a modeled output from Essential Fish Habitat geodatabase and is based upon habitat data, depth, and location, where input data are NMFS trawl datasets. In order to identify reef habitats from the Oregon border to Washington, we used a lithology shapefile [@Goldfinger2014] that was based upon multiple seafloor mapping surveys including multibeam and sidescan sonar, sediment grab and core samples, and images. Seafloor types were classified according to established classification schemes [@Greene1999].  We considered the following lithology types as ‘reef habitat:’ Boulder, cobble, cobble mix, hard, rock, and rock mix.  All spatial data was projected to NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10.


Reef systems were grouped and stratified by depth at a spatial scale biologically meaningful to China rockfish.  China rockfish are typically sedentary and have high site fidelity, therefore we grouped reefs in consideration of how a China rockfish would experience its surroundings.  Lea [-@Lea1999] recaptured China rockfish in the same general location as where they were released, however a few individuals of other rockfish species (copper (\textit{Sebastes caurinus}), gopher (\textit{Sebastes carnatus}), olive (\textit{Sebastes serranoides}) and yellowtail (\textit{Sebastes flavidus})) demonstrated movement up to 1.5 nautical miles (about 2,700 m), but all were captured within the same reef system.  In the Puget Sound copper, brown and quillback were found to have a home range less than 30m\textsuperscript{2} in high relief rocky areas [@Matthews1990].  In other rockfish movement studies, China rockfish were tagged but never recaptured, or there was a sample size of 1 [@Hannah2011], Hannah 2012).  Using this limited information, we considered that China rockfish would swim no more than 200 m over smooth, sand, or muddy habitat to a neighboring reef, therefore if a reef was greater than ~200 m from rocky reef habitat it was considered a different reef system.  If a reef system has contiguous habitat (no channels greater than 200 m) it remained intact, no matter how large the reef (Fig. \cite{MHM_careefs]},\cite{MHM_oreefs}).  A small number of reefs were merged into ‘super reefs’ to accommodate 1980s-1990s CDFW location codes that overlapped multiple reefs [.  Reef areas were calculated using the zonal stats tool in ArcGIS, stratified by the depth bins 0-19 m, 20-39 m, 40-59 m, 60-79 m, 80-99 m and greater than 100 m using the CSMP depth raster (2 m, 3 m or 5 m resolution).  To get depths for those reefs outside the CSMP ‘footprint’ we used the NOAA Coastal Relief Model raster dataset (90 m) for California, and 100 m digital elevation model (DEM) bathymetry from the Active Tectonics and Seafloor Mapping Lab for Oregon.

\newpage
Regions were designated to gain appropriate sample sizes needed for modelling.  For Oregon, region differences north and south of Florence were explored.  In California, 12 regions north of Pt. Conception were defined as follows:

Region 1: Pt. Conception to Pt. Arguello  
Region 2: Purisima Point to Pt. Sal  
Region 3: San Luis Obispo Bay to Mill Creek ($39.959^\circ$ N)  
Region 4: Lopez Point to Monterey Peninsula  
Region 5: Moss Landing to San Francisco Bay  
Region 6: Farallon Islands  
Region 7: Point Bonita to Drakes Bay  
Region 8: Point Reyes to Point Arena  
Region 9: Point Arena to south of Ten Mile River  
Region 10: north of Ten Mile River to Cape Mendocino ($40.16667^\circ$ N)   
Region 11: Cape Mendocino to Eel River  
Region 12: Trinidad Head to CA/OR border  


**CPFV drift selection**
During the 1987-1998 CDFW onboard observer program, fishing location was recorded as one of 459 location codes.  When available, the observer also recorded coordinates, either latitude/longitude or Loran.  The SWFSC converted all Loran coordinates to latitude/longitude.  Using the fishing stops with available coordinates, we assigned a fishing location code to a reef.  A handful of fishing location codes were obviously not associated with a reef, or a reef as identified in the above methods, and were not selected in the final dataset.  If the coordinates spanned two reefs and we were unable to tell which reef was consistently fished for a given location code, we created aggregated the reefs.  This most commonly occurred around the Monterey Bay peninsula.  This was necessary as two-thirds of the fishing stops encountering China rockfish had no recorded coordinates and allowed us to retain all fishing location data.  Therefore, for the 1987-1998 CDFW data,  any fishing location that was assigned to a reef was included in the analyses as one of the filters applied to the data.


For each CPFV location in the California 1999-2014 and Oregon 2001-2014 data we calculated depth, nearest reef, distance from reef, nearest MPA, distance from MPA using ArcGIS.  Geoprocessing steps used were ‘near’ and ‘extract values to points.’ For consistency across databases, we used the starting location of the drift to determine if the drift was targeting fish associated with a reef.  Drifts that had a distance of 0 m, i.e., were fishing directly on the reef, were included in analyses.  Recognizing that some drifts begin adjacent to a reef with the intention of drifting on to the reef, as well as the fact that the starting location may not be recorded at the very start of a drift, we devised a method for including drifts within a certain distance of a reef.  
We compiled a list of rockfish species that are strictly reef associated (black and yellow rockfish (\textit{Sebastes chrysomelas}), canary rockfish  (\textit{Sebastes pinniger}), China rockfish (\textit{Sebastes nebulosus}), cowcod (\textit{Sebastes levis}), flag rockfish  (\textit{Sebastes rubrivinctus}), gopher rockfish (\textit{Sebastes carnatus}), grass rockfish (\textit{Sebastes rastrelliger}), greenblotched rockfish (\textit{Sebastes rosenblatti}), kelp rockfish (\textit{Sebastes atrovirens}), quillback rockfish (\textit{Sebastes maliger}), rosy rockfish (\textit{Sebastes rosaceus}), starry rockfish (\textit{Sebastes constellatus}), Treefish (\textit{Sebastes serriceps}), vermilion rockfish (\textit{Sebastes miniatus}), yelloweye rockfish (\textit{Sebastes ruberrimus})) (personal communication John Field and Tom Laidig, NMFS SWFSC).  Using drifts that were greater than 0m from a reef and encountered one at least one of the fifteen species listed above, we calculated the depth for which 75% of the drifts were included.  For Oregon this was 83 m, and for California it was 34 m for drifts within the ‘footprint’ and 141 m for drifts outside the ‘footprint.’  Any drift (with or without catch) greater than 83 m from a reef was excluded from the analyses.

**Oregon**

The following commercial regulations pertain to China rockfish in Oregon and were provided by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.

China rockfish are managed in teh Other Nearshore Rockfish complex

\textbf{Harvest cap}: Total amount in regulation allowed to be impacted in a fishery (for a given season) including both discard mortality and landed catch mortality.  Prior to 2007 this term was synonymous with “landing cap.”

\textbf{Landing cap}: Total amount in regulation allowed to be landed in a fishery (for a given season).  Includes only landed catch mortality (known as a harvest cap before 2007).  

**Incidental Catch Limits in Other Fisheries (established in 2004)**

\textbf{Non-permitted vessels}: 15 lbs per day of black rockfish, blue rockfish, and nearshore fish, combined, for no more than one landing per day.  These species must make-up 25% or less of landed poundage, and must be taken with gear legal in the permitted fishery.

\textbf{Groundfish trawl fishery}: Vessels may land no more than 1,000 lbs of dead black rockfish, blue rockfish, and nearshore fish combined per calendar year if these species make-up 25% or less of landing.

\textbf{Non-profit aquaria or vessels contracted by non-profit aquaria} may land black rockfish, blue rockfish, and nearshore fish for purposes of display or for conducting research on these species.

**Regulations History**

A minimum size limit of 12 inches (measured from the tip of the snout to the extreme end of the tail) was implemented for China rockfish in 2000.  A sorting requirement for China rockfish was implemented in 2003.

**Nearshore Fishery Bycatch Permit**
This special non-transferrable permit is issued as of 2003 to those qualifying individuals who use either trawl or entangling nets (gill nets).  It allows a minimal bycatch of minor nearshore species (which includes China rockfish) as per the following:

   
   South Central Coast Region 25 pounds of nearshore fish stocks may be taken per trip

   South Coast Region – 50 pounds of nearshore fish stocks may be taken per trip
 
   No permits are issued for either the North Coast or North-Central Coast Regions.
