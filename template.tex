\subsection{Uncertainty and Sensitivity
Analyses}\label{uncertainty-and-sensitivity-analyses}

\label{sec:uncertainty} The best approach for describing uncertainty and
the range of probable biomass estimates in groundfish assessments may
depend on the situation.\\Important factors to consider include:

\subsubsection{Title}\label{title-33}

Parameter uncertainty (variance estimation conditioned on a given model,
estimation framework, data set choice, and weighting scheme), including
likelihood profiles for important assessment parameters (e.g., natural
mortality). This also includes expressing uncertainty in derived outputs
of the model and estimating CVs using appropriate methods (e.g.,
bootstrap, asymptotic methods, Bayesian approaches, such as MCMC).
Include the CV of spawning biomass in the first year for which an OFL
has not been specified (typically end year +1 or +2).

\subsubsection{Title}\label{title-34}

Sensitivity to assumptions about model structure, i.e., model
specification uncertainty

\subsubsection{Title}\label{title-35}

Sensitivity to data set choice and weighting schemes (e.g., emphasis
factors), which may also include a consideration of recent patterns in
recruitment.

\subsubsection{Title}\label{title-36}

Retrospective analysis, where the model is fitted to a series of
shortened input data sets, with the most recent years of input data
being dropped.

\subsubsection{Title}\label{title-37}

Historical analysis (plot of actual estimates from current and previous
assessments).

\subsubsection{Title}\label{title-38}

Subjective appraisal of the magnitude and sources of uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Title}\label{title-39}

If a range of model runs is used to characterize uncertainty it is
important to provide some qualitative or quantitative information about
relative probability of each. If no statements about relative
probability can be made, then it is important to state that all
scenarios (or all scenarios between the bounds depicted by the runs) are
equally likely

\subsubsection{Title}\label{title-40}

\label{sec:uncertaintylast} If possible, ranges depicting uncertainty
should include at least three runs: (a) one judged most probable; (b) at
least one that depicts the range of uncertainty in the direction of
lower current biomass levels; and (c) one that depicts the range of
uncertainty in the direction of higher current biomass levels. The
entire range of uncertainty should be carried through stock projections
and decision table analyses.

\section{Harvest Projections and Decision Tables (Groundfish
Only)}\label{harvest-projections-and-decision-tables-groundfish-only}

*Not required in draft assessment undergoing review.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Harvest projections and decision tables (i.e., a matrix of alternative
  models (states of nature) versus management actions) should cover the
  plausible range of uncertainty about current stock biomass and a set
  of candidate fishing mortality targets used for the stock. See section
  ``\textit{Uncertainty and Decision Tables in Groundfish Stock Assessment}''
  (this document, pp.
  \pageref{sec:uncertainty}-\pageref{sec:uncertaintylast}) on how to
  define alternative states of nature. Management decisions in most
  cases represent the sequence of catches including estimate of OFL
  based on FMSY (or its proxy) and those obtained by applying the
  Council 40-10 harvest policy to each state of nature; however other
  alternatives may be suggested by the GMT as being more relevant to
  Council decision making. OFL calculations should be based on the
  assumption that future catches equal ABCs and not OFLs.
\item
  Information presented should include biomass, stock depletion, and
  yield projections of OFL, ABC and ACL for ten years into the future,
  beginning with the first year for which management action could be
  based upon the assessment.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Regional Management
Considerations}\label{regional-management-considerations}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  For stocks where current practice is to allocate harvests by
  management area, a recommended method of allocating harvests based on
  the distribution of biomass should be provided. The MT advisor should
  be consulted on the appropriate management areas for each stock.
\item
  Discuss whether a regional management approach makes sense for the
  species from a biological perspective.
\item
  If there are insufficient data to analyze a regional management
  approach, what are the research and data needs to answer this
  question?

Beginning in 1992 Calrec Historic began tracking the number of observed
anglers in its database, however the full data-set spans from 4/22/87
until 12/31/98. The goal of this analysis is to impute the number of
observed anglers in the initial period of the dataset, from 4/22/87
until 7/9/92, when the observed number of active anglers was not yet
being recorded.

The number of observed anglers is necessarily a subset of the number of
total anglers; a quantity which is consistently recorded throughout the
entire dataset. This suggests that a simple binomial regression model
could be used to predict the mean number of observed anglers from the
number of total anglers, in the initial period of the data. Binomial
regression models of this general form were considered in this analysis,
as well as a sensitivity analysis among the other potential covariates
available in the dataset. Among the potential predictor variables in
this study, effects related to the interviewer, trip date, and the
trip's identification number (trip ID) number were considered for
inclusion in the final model by pairwise comparison of fitted model AIC
values as well as analysis of parameter significance.

Effects related to interviewer were found to be very significant,
although due to the high turn-over rate of the interviewers in these
data, interviewer specific effects are not useful for prediction here.
However, the total number of present interviewers (one or two
interviewers) was found to be strongly significant and was included in
the final models as a categorical effect.

For imputing the observed number of active anglers for the early period
of the dataset it is important to motivate an assumption of stationarity
in the number of observed anglers through time. Thus trip date was
considered for inclusion in the model to check for any possibility
significance through time. Firstly, date was considered for inclusion in
the model as a discrete time variable; secondly, a separate model was
tested using only year as categorical variable to consider any temporal
patterns. Given the number of total anglers, neither of the models
considering temporal effects were able demonstrate that the number of
observed anglers varied significantly through time. All models which
included temporal effects produced higher overall AIC values, thus
supporting the assumption of stationarity in time.

Trip ID was found to contribute a significant effect toward overall
inference. Upon further investigation, trip ID was found to encode
information about the number of consecutive outings for each interviewer
followed by a decimal point and a unique numeric code for each
interviewer. This suggests that by ignoring the numbers after the
decimal point one could represent a measure of the generic interviewer
experience. Inclusion of this variable was tested and is supported by
the fitted AIC and parameter significance as a discrete experience
variable. Although this variable was supported by the chosen model
selection criteria, it was ultimately left out of the final models for
further investigation of accuracy of the coding scheme.

\begin{equation}
y_{ij} \sim B\Big( ~N_{ij}, ~\text{logit}\big(\beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} \log(x_{ij})\big)~ \Big)
\end{equation}

The log model considers a typical normal linear model for each
interviewer level, except it uses the log of the number of total anglers
as a predictor rather than the raw numbers of total anglers. The log
model has several nice features for prediction in this case. Firstly by
regressing on the log of the total anglers it improves the correlation
and relative homoscedasticity of the joint data and improves the
accuracy of sensitivity analysis by improving the standard error
estimates for each parameter. Secondly the log transformation introduces
the expected mean prediction shape, by emphasizing order of magnitude
differences in the total number of anglers. The binomial log model
considers the observed angler counts as independent draws from a
binomial given the know number of total anglers. The log transformation
in the binomial case is justified over the traditional binomial glm for
similar reasons as the normal log model, as well as simple AIC support
of the transformation. All models and model selection criterion were
computed using the standard \verb|glm| function in the R software
environment for statistical computing \cite{rBase}.

The binomial log model was chosen for its low AIC value and reasonable
mean predictions. Untransformed binomial models were considered, however
they produce unreasonable observed angler predictions associated with
the high numbers of total anglers. The log transformed Normal model
provides mostly reasonable predictions, but is not supported by AIC when
compared to the binomial models. Additionally transforms of Normal
likelihood models have no distributional way of producing observed
angler predictions which do not exceed the total number of anglers. If a
Normal likelihood model were to gather AIC support, predictions may
require truncation. These data contain considerable noise, likely due to
the high interviewer turnover rate, which would most effectively be
modeled by including appropriate additional predictors to control for
these effects. At this point no additional predictors from this dataset
were considered to be both sensitive and appropriate for use with
prediction in this case.
