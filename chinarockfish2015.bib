Most species listed in the Pacific Coast$\backslash$nGroundfish Fishery Management Plan have not been assessed, in large part due to data limitations.$\backslash$nEstimates of sustainable yield for many these species were previously based on undocumented, ad-hoc$\backslash$nanalyses. We present estimates of sustainable yield for 50 of these stocks using two recently developed$\backslash$nmodels designed to inform management of data-poor stocks. These models rely on recently$\backslash$nreconstructed time series of historical catch for west-coast groundfish species and species-specific$\backslash$ninformation related to stock productivity. For this set of data-poor stocks, recent landings statistics$\backslash$nreflect shifts in the relative importance of certain species to west-coast fisheries (e.g. increased catches$\backslash$nof nearshore and slope rockfish species relative to shelf species), largely due to recent regulatory$\backslash$nactions. We provide estimates of overfishing limits (OFLs) for each of the 50 stocks along with$\backslash$ncomparisons to recent catch levels. Our results suggest that status quo harvest levels range from light$\backslash$nexploitation of some stocks to potential overfishing of others. This information could help inform$\backslash$ndecisions regarding prioritization of future stock assessments for unassessed species. OFLs are$\backslash$nexpressed as probability distributions, reflecting our uncertainty in model parameters. We select median$\backslash$nvalues as point estimates of OFL, as this statistic is most consistent with National Standard 1 guidelines.},

abstract = {The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) requires active management of all stocks at risk of overfishing or otherwise in need of conservation and management. In the Pacific Fishery Management Council groundfish fishery management plan, about two-thirds of the more than 90 managed stocks are currently without traditional assessments to help define stock status in relation to management targets. Stock complexes are often employed for management purposes in such situations. The guidelines issued in response to the 2006 MSA amendments defined a complex as a group of stocks with similar geographic distributions, life histories, and vulnerabilities to fisheries. This work uses productivity-susceptibility analysis (PSA) to measure the vulnerabilities of 90 managed groundfish stocks, 64 of which are currently managed within stock complexes. These stock complexes are reevaluated by first using a partitioning cluster analysis to group the stocks by depth and latitude. Vulnerability reference points are then established based on the PSA results to determine vulnerability groups of low, medium, high, and major concern within each ecological group. This method is a simple and flexible approach to incorporating vulnerability measures into stock complex designations while providing information with which to prioritize stock- and complex-specific management.},

As fishing effort increased, the catch of certain nearhore species  of rockfish declined. CPFV fishing was conducted farther from port and in deeper water to compensate for declining abundance while most skiffs remained in traditional areas close to port. The trend toward deeper water CPFV fishing has been interrrupted only temporarily by increased availability of nearshore spp. Life  history characteristics of rockfish including rresidential behavior, variable recruitment, and natural longevity contribute to a vulnerability to localized overfishing for several species.},

Data describing species, location, and size of schools can be inexpensively obtained from fish spotters but are difficult to interpret statistically. We developed an index of relative abundance from fish spotter data based on extended delta-lognormal models and applied the method to data for northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). In contrast with previous approaches, our method used all available data, provided an index for northern anchovy that was proportional to abundance, and explicitly modeled factors (pilots, regions, seasons, and time of day) that affected observations by fish spotters. We also included information about mixed layer depth and sea surface temperature in models for a reduced study area and found that envi- ronmental data, where available, can be used to improve estimates of relative abundance from fish spotter data. Simulation results indicated that our approach is a cost-effective way to improve biomass estimates for pelagic species like northern anchovy},

abstract = {Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have historically comprised a large proportion of catches in the nearshore recre- ational fishery in California, but declining populations of some species have led to increasingly restrictive man- agement of the resource. This report summarizes new and existing data on rockfishes of the south central coast of California. In 2003, the California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo placed observers on com- mercial passenger fishing vessels (partyboats) from the region. By the end of 2005, we had observed catches from 258 trips (8,839 fisher hours). We appended these data to partyboat catch statistics collected by the California Department of Fish and Game from 1988 to 1998 and calculated annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) and mean sizes by species and year. The CPUE data by species fluctuate annually but rarely show consistent trends. The overall CPUE for 2004 and 2005 ranks in the top five of the twenty sampled years. Mean sizes have been con- sistent by species, generally just above the size of 50\% maturity. Comparing these sizes to historical data shows decreases in some species but not in others. A review of NOAA/NMFS triennial trawl data for the Point Conception area in the southern part of the study re- gion suggests that the deeper shelf and slope species, with a few exceptions, show little evidence of long-term declines. In general, the south central coast rockfish re- sources, with the exception of bocaccio (S. paucispinis), have not shown strong evidence of a declining trend over},

abstract = {Accurate efficient estimation of actual and potential species distribution is a critical requirement for effective ecosystem-based management and marine protected area design. In this study we tested the applicability of a terrestrial landscape modeling technique in a marine environ- ment for predicting the distribution of ecologically and economically important groundfish, using 3 species of rockfish at Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) as a model system. Auto- classification of multibeam bathymetry along with georeferenced submersible video transect data of the seafloor and demersal fishes were used to model the abundance and distribution of rockfish. Gen- eralized linear models (GLMs) were created using habitat classification analyses of high-resolution (3 m) digital elevation models combined with fish presence/absence observations. Model accuracy was assessed using a reserved subset of the observation data. The resulting probability of occurrence models generated at 3 m resolution for the entire 120 km2 study area proved reliable in predicting the distribution of all the species. The accuracies of the models for Sebastes rosaceus, S. flavidus and S. elongatus were 96, 92 and 92\%, respectively. The probability of occurrence of S. flavidus and S. rosaceus was highest in the high relief rocky areas and lowest in the low relief, soft sediment areas. The model for S. elongatus had an opposite pattern, with the highest predicted probability of occur- rence taking place in the low relief, soft sediment areas and a lower probability of occurrence in the rocky areas. These results indicate that site-specific and species-specific algorithmic habitat classifi- cation applied to high-resolution bathymetry data can be used to accurately extrapolate the results from in situ video surveys of demersal fishes across broad areas of habitat.},

Our primary interest was evaluating potential residence times for rockfish species in small, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) like those recently designated for Oregon waters (337-1,502 ha). We tagged 6 black rockfish S. melanops, 31 canary rockfish S. pinniger, 9 yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus, 5 quillback rockfish S. maliger, and 2 copper rockfish S. caurinus, along with single specimens of china rockfish S. nebulosus, vermilion rockfish S. miniatus, and tiger rockfish S. nigrocinctus, and monitored their movements with a large (about 5,200-ha) receiver grid for over a year. Canary rockfish showed low site fidelity and wide-ranging movements that exceeded the scale of our detection grid and a wide range of vertical movements (up to 27 m). Quillback, vermilion, tiger, china, and some yelloweye rockfish showed high site fidelity, being detected only at one or two nearby receivers for a full year. The range of vertical movements of yelloweye, quillback, vermilion, and tiger rockfish was small, ranging from only 2-3 m for the single tiger rockfish to 3-13 m for four of the quillback rockfish. Black and copper rockfish showed site fidelity that was intermediate between that of canary rockfish and the other species. Black and copper rockfish showed a wide range in vertical movements (10-35 m and 2-33 m, respectively) within a month. Our results suggest that small, no-take MPAs located on high-relief rocky reefs would provide minimal protection for canary rockfish, some protection for black and copper rockfish, and greater protection for quillback, vermilion, tiger, and some yelloweye rockfish.},
